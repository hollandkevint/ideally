# BMAD PMF Validation Expansion Pack

## Overview

The PMF Validation expansion pack helps solopreneurs and microsaas founders systematically find product-market fit through demand discovery, case study selling, and rapid iteration. Based on proven methodologies that have taken multiple companies from $0-$1M+ ARR, this pack provides the tools to escape the "pain cave" and build products people actually want to buy.

## Core Philosophy

**"You don't create demand. You find it."**

This expansion pack implements a demand-first approach where you:

1. Draft a theoretical case study
2. Use it to sell and learn
3. Debug based on real customer feedback until you achieve "hell yes" responses
4. Deliver manually to ensure retention before automating

   ```bash
   bmad install --expansion bmad-pmf-validation
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Start with the full team**:

   ```bash
   bmad --team pmf-validation-team
   ```

2. **Or activate a specific agent**:

   ```bash
   bmad --agent pmf-strategist
   ```

3. **Run a specific workflow**:
   ```bash
   bmad --workflow zero-to-first-customer
   ```

## The 5 Levels of PMF

Track your progress through these levels:

1. **Level 1**: Don't have a customer case study worth replicating
2. **Level 2**: Have a case study, but can't consistently replicate it
3. **Level 3**: Can replicate a case study, but it's not a "hell yes" every time
4. **Level 4**: Can replicate a "hell yes" case study, just need a growth lever
5. **Level 5**: "Hell yes" case study + growth lever, holding on for dear life

## Key Principles

### 1. Demand-First Thinking

- Focus on what customers are trying to accomplish
- Understand their project prioritization
- Identify when and why they take action

### 2. Case Study as North Star

- One real person, not abstract personas
- Exact clones minimize variance
- Replication drives growth

### 3. Sell to Learn

- Real money changes conversations
- Each call is a learning opportunity
- Debug systematically after every interaction

### 4. Manual Before Automated

- Do things that don't scale first
- Understand what drives retention
- Automate only proven processes

### 5. Unfold, Don't Pivot

- Build on accumulated knowledge
- Evolution strengthens your position
- Compound advantages over time

## Example Commands

### Create Your First Case Study

```bash
bmad --agent case-study-architect
> *draft-case-study
```

### Analyze a Sales Call

```bash
bmad --agent sales-debugger
> *analyze-call
```

### Design Manual Delivery

```bash
bmad --agent customer-success-engineer
> *manual-delivery
```

### Find Demand Patterns

```bash
bmad --agent demand-researcher
> *demand-analysis
```

## Use Cases

This expansion pack is ideal for:

- **B2B SaaS Founders**: Finding initial product-market fit
- **Solopreneurs**: Validating ideas before building
- **MicroSaaS Builders**: Discovering profitable niches
- **Service Businesses**: Productizing offerings
- **Consultants**: Transitioning to scalable products
- **Early-Stage Teams**: Systematic PMF discovery

## Common Patterns

### From Pain Cave to PMF

1. **The Research Trap**: Endless customer interviews without selling
2. **The Feature Factory**: Building based on requests, not demand
3. **The Pivot Loop**: Constantly changing direction without learning
4. **The Scale Trap**: Trying to grow before achieving retention

### The Way Out

1. **Pick One Customer**: Start with a real person, not a persona
2. **Sell Something**: Use a theoretical case study to start
3. **Learn Fast**: 5-10 sales calls per week minimum
4. **Debug Systematically**: After each call, refine your case study
5. **Deliver Manually**: Ensure success by any means necessary

## Best Practices

1. **Schedule 5-10 Sales Calls Weekly**: Volume drives learning
2. **Record Everything**: Review calls for 15-30 minutes each
3. **Weekly Reflections**: Debug your case study systematically
4. **Measure Retention**: Focus on post-sale success, not just closes
5. **Document Patterns**: Track what causes "hell yes" responses

## Warning Signs

- Spending more time on strategy than talking to customers
- Building features before validating demand
- Low willingness to pay despite "interest"
- Complex explanations of what you do
- Pushing uphill instead of feeling pull

## Success Metrics

- **Close Rate**: Target 60%+ on qualified calls
- **Sales Cycle**: Should shorten as case study improves
- **Retention**: 90%+ monthly retention before scaling
- **Referrals**: Customers actively recommending you
- **Pull Feeling**: Customers asking "when can we start?"
