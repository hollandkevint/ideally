# Design Manual Delivery Task

## Purpose

To create a manual delivery approach that ensures customer success and reveals the key drivers of retention. By doing things that don't scale first, you understand exactly what creates customer "equilibrium" before building automated systems.

## Inputs

- Signed customer or strong verbal commitment
- Clear understanding of promised results
- Timeline expectations from sales process
- Resources available (your time, tools, team)
- Technical capabilities currently available

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Define Success Outcome

Document exactly what success looks like:

- **Customer's Definition**: In their words from sales call
- **Measurable Outcome**: Specific metrics or milestones
- **Timeline**: When they expect to see results
- **Evidence of Success**: How they'll know it worked
- **<critical_rule>Success must be defined before delivery begins</critical_rule>**

### 2. Map the Manual Journey

Design the customer journey from purchase to success:

#### 2.1 Onboarding Phase (Days 1-7)

- [ ] Welcome sequence design
- [ ] Expectation setting communication
- [ ] Initial data/access gathering
- [ ] Quick win identification
- [ ] First value delivery target

#### 2.2 Implementation Phase (Weeks 1-4)

- [ ] Weekly milestone mapping
- [ ] Manual work required from you
- [ ] Customer effort needed
- [ ] Checkpoint conversations
- [ ] Progress tracking method

#### 2.3 Success Phase (Months 1-3)

- [ ] Success metric monitoring
- [ ] Usage pattern establishment
- [ ] Habit formation support
- [ ] Value reinforcement cadence
- [ ] Expansion opportunity identification

### 3. Identify Manual Components

List everything you'll do manually initially:

**Data/Process Work:**

- [ ] Referral mentions

**Success Milestones:**

- [ ] First value realized
- [ ] Habit formation point
- [ ] ROI break-even

### 6. Create Intervention Playbook

Define triggers and responses:

| Signal              | Intervention                 | Timeline   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| No login for 3 days | Personal email check-in      | Same day   |
| Missed milestone    | Call to diagnose blockers    | Within 24h |
| Support request     | Founder responds directly    | Within 2h  |
| Success milestone   | Celebration + case study ask | Same week  |

### 7. Document the Manual Process

Create detailed documentation:

#### 7.1 Daily Tasks

- What you check every morning
- Manual processes to run
- Customer communications
- Data updates needed
- Time requirement

- Customer success calls
- Report generation
- Progress analysis
- Intervention checks
- Process improvements

#### 7.3 Tools and Resources

- Communication templates
- Tracking mechanisms
- Manual workflow steps
- Time-saving shortcuts

### 8. Identify Automation Opportunities

Note what could be automated later:

**Immediate Automation Candidates:**

- Repetitive data entry

- Basic email sequences
- Simple if/then workflows

**Future Automation Potential:**

- Complex decision trees
- Predictive interventions
- Personalized recommendations
- Advanced analytics

**Must Stay Manual:**

- Relationship building
- Complex problem solving
- Strategic guidance
- Customization decisions

### 9. Calculate Unit Economics

Understand the economics of manual delivery:

- **Time per Customer**: Hours per week required
- **Maximum Capacity**: How many can you handle?
- **Break-even Point**: Revenue vs. time cost
- **Automation ROI**: When to invest in systems
- **<important_note>Don't scale until economics make sense</important_note>**

### 10. Create Customer Success Assets

Develop materials to support success:

- Onboarding checklist for customers
