# Draft Case Study Task

## Purpose

To create an initial theoretical case study that serves as the foundation for your sales-based learning approach. This case study will evolve based on real customer feedback but provides a starting point for conversations.

## Inputs

- Initial product idea or concept
- Target customer hypothesis
- Understanding of the problem space
- Any existing customer insights or conversations
- Competitive landscape awareness

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Choose Your Target Person

- **<critical_rule>Pick ONE REAL PERSON as your target, not a composite or persona</critical_rule>**
- **Identify Specifically**: Choose someone you know or can clearly visualize
- **Decision Maker Focus**: Ensure they have budget authority
- **Reachable**: You should be able to contact similar people

Questions to answer:

- [ ] Who is this specific person? (Name, role, company type)
- [ ] Why did you choose them as your ideal customer?
- [ ] What makes them reachable for you?

### 2. Define the Project (What They're Trying to Accomplish)

Map out the specific project your target customer needs to complete:

- **Project Name**: How would they describe it internally?
- **Project Scope**: What does "done" look like?
- **Success Criteria**: How do they measure completion?
- \*\*<important_note>Focus on their language, not your product features</important_note>

Example format:
"[Role] wants to [accomplish specific outcome] so that [business impact]"

### 3. Establish Context (Why This Project, Why Now)

Identify what causes this project to become a priority:

#### 3.1 Catalysts

- [ ] External pressure (regulation, competition, market change)
- [ ] Internal mandate (new leadership, strategy shift)
- [ ] Growth blocker (can't scale without solving this)
- [ ] Risk event (security breach, major failure)

#### 3.2 Timing Factors

- [ ] Specific deadline or event
- [ ] Budget availability window
- [ ] Team bandwidth opening
- [ ] Strategic planning cycle

### 4. Map Options (What They Consider)

List all realistic options your customer evaluates:

1. **Do Nothing**: Status quo (always an option)
2. **Build Internally**: Use existing team/resources
3. **Hire Someone**: FTE or contractor
4. **Buy Different Solution**: Direct competitors
5. **Your Solution**: Where you fit in

For each option, note:

- Perceived pros/cons from customer perspective
- Rough cost/effort estimation
- Why they might choose or reject

### 5. Articulate Results (Success State)

Define what success looks like in customer terms:

- **Immediate Outcome**: What changes right away?
- **30-Day Impact**: Early indicators of success
- **90-Day Transformation**: Full realization of value
- **Ongoing State**: New equilibrium achieved

Use specific, measurable outcomes where possible.

### 6. Explain How (Path to Results)

Outline how your solution helps achieve results:

#### 6.1 Implementation Steps

1. Initial setup/onboarding (timeline)
2. Key milestones to first value
3. Ongoing usage pattern
4. Success checkpoints

#### 6.2 Customer Experience

- What they do vs. what you do
- Level of effort required
- Change management needs
- Support/training included

### 7. Package What (The Offer)

Define your specific offer:

- **Core Deliverable**: What exactly they get
- **Service Level**: Support, guarantees, SLAs
- **Pricing Model**: One-time, subscription, usage-based
- **Terms**: Contract length, payment terms
- **Risk Reversal**: Guarantees, trials, proof of concept

### 8. Write the Case Study

Combine all elements into a flowing narrative:

```
[Customer Name] at [Company Type] needed to [Project] because [Context].

They considered [Options] but chose us because [Unique Differentiator].

Within [Timeframe], they achieved [Specific Results] by [How We Helped].

They invested [Price] for [What They Got], which delivered [ROI/Value].
```

### 9. Pressure Test

Review your case study against these criteria:

- [ ] Would target customer recognize themselves?
- [ ] Is the project something they'd actually prioritize?
- [ ] Are the results compelling enough to act?
- [ ] Is the price justified by the value?
- [ ] Can you deliver what you're promising?

### 10. Create Variations

Develop 2-3 variations to test:

- **Different Projects**: Same person, different priority
- **Different Context**: Same project, different catalyst
- **Different Results**: Same project, different success metric

## Output

- One primary case study (6 parts complete)
- 2-3 variations for testing
- List of assumptions to validate
- Questions to ask in sales calls
- Hypothesis about which version will resonate most

## Success Criteria

- Case study feels specific and real, not generic
- Clear cause-and-effect from project to results
- Price aligned with value delivered
- You're excited to test it with real prospects
- Takes less than 60 seconds to explain

## Follow-up Actions

- Create sales pitch deck from case study
- Schedule 5-10 calls to test with prospects
- Prepare to capture feedback systematically
- Plan weekly case study evolution sessions
- Set up tracking for resonance indicators

## Notes

- Your first case study is just a starting point - it will evolve
- Specificity beats broad appeal initially
- When in doubt, make it more concrete
- The goal is learning, not perfection
- Real sales conversations will reveal what needs to change
