# Design Outreach Campaign Task

## Purpose

To create personalized outreach messages that generate 5-10 quality sales conversations per week. Focus on messages only you can send to only them, emphasizing what's in it for the recipient.

## Inputs

- Validated demand patterns
- Target customer profile
- Your unique advantages/credibility
- Case study highlights
- Channel preferences (email, LinkedIn, etc.)

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Define Your Outreach Goals

Set clear campaign objectives:

- **Quantity Target**: 5-10 qualified meetings/week
- **Quality Criteria**: Match demand patterns identified
- **Response Rate Goal**: 10-20% for cold, 30%+ for warm
- **Meeting Show Rate**: 80%+ target
- **<critical_rule>Quality over quantity - fewer, better messages win</critical_rule>**

### 2. Identify Your "Only You" Advantages

What makes your outreach credible:

**Founder Advantages:**

- [ ] Personal story/experience
- [ ] Domain expertise
- [ ] Shared background
- [ ] Network connections
- [ ] Unique insights

**Company Advantages:**

- [ ] Specific customer results
- [ ] Innovative approach
- [ ] Timing/market position
- [ ] Exclusive access/data

### 3. Segment Your Targets

Create specific segments based on demand patterns:

#### Segment Template:

```
Segment Name: [Label]
Demand Pattern: [Which pattern they fit]
Trigger Signals: [What to look for]
Channels: [Where to reach them]
Volume: [# of targets]
Message Angle: [Hook approach]
```

Example segments:

- Recently funded companies (growth pressure)
- New executive hires (mandate to improve)
- Companies using competitor (switching opportunity)
- Fast-growing teams (scaling challenges)

### 4. Craft Message Templates

Create templates that feel personal:

#### Cold Email Template:

```
Subject: [Specific observation about them]

Hi [Name],

[Specific trigger or observation about their company]

[How this typically creates specific challenge]

[Brief case study teaser - similar company result]

[Clear, single call-to-action]

[Signature with credibility marker]
```

#### LinkedIn Message Template:

```
Hi [Name],

[Connection context or mutual interest]

[Relevant insight or observation]

[Value-first offer or question]

[Low-friction next step]
```

### 5. Personalization Framework

Make each message feel one-to-one:

**Research Checklist (2-3 minutes max):**

- [ ] Recent company news/announcements
- [ ] Their role-specific challenges
- [ ] Technology stack/tools they use
- [ ] Growth trajectory/metrics
- [ ] Competitive landscape
- [ ] Their content/thought leadership

**Personalization Elements:**

- First line: Company-specific observation
- Problem: Their likely current priority
- Solution: Relevant case study selection
- CTA: Appropriate to their stage

### 6. Create Message Variations

Test different angles:

**Angle 1: Direct Value**
"I helped [similar company] achieve [specific result]..."

**Angle 2: Problem Recognition**
"I noticed [observation] and typically that means [challenge]..."

**Angle 3: Peer Insight**
"Just had an interesting conversation with another [role] about..."

**Angle 4: Tactical Help**
"I've got a quick framework for [specific problem] that might help..."

**Angle 5: Exclusive Access**
"We're working with 3 [company type] on [problem] and learning..."

### 7. Design Follow-up Sequences

Create persistence without annoyance:

**Follow-up 1 (Day 3):**

- Add new value/insight
- Reference original message
- Simpler CTA

**Follow-up 2 (Day 7):**

- Different angle entirely
- Share specific resource
- Yes/no question

**Follow-up 3 (Day 14):**

- Brief check-in
- Timing question
- Permission to circle back

**Break-up (Day 21):**

- Acknowledge not right time
- Leave door open
- Share one last insight

### 8. Set Up Your Outreach System

Build a sustainable process:

#### Daily Workflow:

1. **Research Block** (30 min): Identify 10 targets
2. **Writing Block** (45 min): Craft personalized messages
3. **Send Window** (15 min): Deploy messages
4. **Response Handling** (30 min): Book meetings
5. **Tracking** (10 min): Update metrics

#### Tools Setup:

- CRM or spreadsheet for tracking
- Email/LinkedIn templates library
- Calendar scheduling tool
- Response rate tracking
- A/B test documentation

### 9. Optimize Subject Lines

Test high-performing formats:

**Question Format:**
"Quick question about [specific thing]"

**Observation Format:**
"Noticed [specific trigger] at [Company]"

**Connection Format:**
"[Mutual connection] suggested we connect"

**Value Format:**
"How [similar company] solved [problem]"

**Avoid:**

- Generic benefits ("Increase revenue")
- Hyperbole ("Revolutionary solution")
- Mass mail signals ("Hi there")

### 10. Measure and Iterate

Track what matters:

**Response Metrics:**

- Open rate (subject line effectiveness)
- Response rate (message relevance)
- Positive vs. negative responses
- Meeting book rate
- Show-up rate

**Quality Metrics:**

- Match to ideal customer profile
- Demand pattern alignment
- Sales cycle velocity
