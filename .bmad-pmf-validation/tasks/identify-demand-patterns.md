# Identify Demand Patterns Task

## Purpose

To systematically analyze customer interactions and extract recurring demand patterns that reveal what causes people to buy. Understanding these patterns allows you to focus on customers with the highest demand intensity and refine your case study accordingly.

## Inputs

- Notes from 5+ customer conversations
- Sales call recordings or transcripts
- Closed won/lost deal analysis
- Customer support interactions
- Inbound inquiry patterns
- Competitor intelligence

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Collect Demand Data Points

Gather all customer interaction data:

#### 1.1 Direct Demand Signals

- **Explicit Statements**: "We need to solve X by Y date"
- **Budget Mentions**: "We have $X allocated for this"
- **Timeline Pressure**: "This is critical for Q2"
- **Team Involvement**: Multiple stakeholders engaged
- **Process Questions**: "How quickly can we implement?"

#### 1.2 Indirect Demand Signals

- Question depth and specificity
- Meeting attendance and punctuality
- Follow-up speed and thoroughness
- Internal champion emergence
- Resource allocation discussions

### 2. Map Customer Projects

For each customer interaction, identify:

**The Core Project:**

- What are they trying to accomplish? (in their words)
- What does "done" look like to them?
- Who owns this project internally?
- What's the business impact of completion?

**<critical_rule>Use their exact language, not your interpretation</critical_rule>**

Example mapping:

```
Customer A: "Get our sales team ramped faster"
Customer B: "Reduce time to first deal"
Customer C: "Onboard new reps in half the time"
Pattern: Sales team productivity project
```

### 3. Analyze Context Patterns

Identify what causes projects to become priorities:

#### 3.1 External Catalysts

- [ ] New competitor threat
- [ ] Market opportunity window
- [ ] Regulatory deadline
- [ ] Economic pressure
- [ ] Technology shift

#### 3.2 Internal Catalysts

- [ ] Leadership change
- [ ] Growth targets
- [ ] Bad quarter/incident
- [ ] Strategic initiative
- [ ] Resource constraints

#### 3.3 Timing Patterns

Map when projects move from "someday" to "now":

- Annual planning cycles
- Post-funding events
- Seasonal pressures
- Crisis moments
- New hire waves

### 4. Examine Options Landscape

Document how customers evaluate solutions:

**Option Categories:**

1. **Status Quo**: Why isn't it working anymore?
2. **Build Internally**: What stops them?
3. **Hire Someone**: Why not this path?
4. **Direct Competitors**: How do you compare?
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Creative workarounds?

**Decision Criteria Patterns:**

- Speed to value
- Total cost (time + money)
- Risk factors
- Internal capabilities
- Past experiences

### 5. Success Pattern Recognition

Identify common success definitions:

#### 5.1 Quantifiable Outcomes

- Specific metrics improved
- Time/cost savings achieved
- Revenue/growth targets hit
- Risk metrics reduced

#### 5.2 Qualitative Outcomes

- Team satisfaction
- Process simplification
- Competitive advantage
- Peace of mind

#### 5.3 Evidence of Success

What tells them they've succeeded?

- Internal measurements
- External validation
- Behavioral changes
- System indicators

### 6. Demand Intensity Scoring

Rate each pattern by intensity:

**High Intensity (Pull) Indicators:**

- ✓ Clear deadline or forcing function
- ✓ Budget already allocated
- ✓ Multiple stakeholders involved
- ✓ Active evaluation process
- ✓ High cost of inaction

**Low Intensity (Push) Indicators:**

- ✗ "Nice to have" language
- ✗ No clear timeline
- ✗ Single person interested
- ✗ No budget discussion
- ✗ Happy with status quo

### 7. Create Pattern Profiles

Develop 2-3 distinct demand profiles:

**Profile Template:**

```
Profile Name: [Descriptive label]
Trigger Event: [What causes action]
Core Project: [What they're accomplishing]
Timeline Driver: [Why now]
Success Metric: [How they measure]
Buying Process: [How they decide]
Intensity Level: [High/Medium/Low]
Volume Estimate: [Market size]
```

### 8. Validate Pattern Hypotheses

Test your pattern identification:

- [ ] Do multiple customers fit each pattern?
- [ ] Can you predict demand based on patterns?
- [ ] Do patterns explain win/loss results?
- [ ] Are patterns specific enough to target?
- [ ] Do patterns suggest case study changes?

### 9. Identify Anti-Patterns

Document what doesn't work:

**False Positive Indicators:**

- Interest without urgency
- Feature fascination
- Price shopping only
- Tire kicker behaviors
- Innovation theater

**Mismatch Patterns:**

- Wrong problem focus
- Incorrect buyer level
- Bad timing approach
- Misaligned success metrics

### 10. Apply Patterns to Strategy

Translate patterns into action:

#### 10.1 Targeting Refinement

- Ideal customer profile updates
- Outreach message focusing
- Qualification criteria
- Channel selection

#### 10.2 Case Study Evolution

- Which pattern to optimize for
- Context section refinement
- Options positioning
- Results promise adjustment

#### 10.3 Sales Process Optimization

- Discovery question updates
- Objection anticipation
- Proof points needed
- Close sequence timing
