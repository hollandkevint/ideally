# Design Discovery Plan Task

## Purpose

To create a systematic customer discovery plan using SVPG continuous discovery methodologies. This plan establishes regular customer interaction patterns, research methods, and learning objectives to drive evidence-based product decisions.

## Inputs

- Product opportunity or problem space to explore
- Target customer segments and personas
- Key assumptions and hypotheses to test
- Business objectives and success criteria
- Available resources and timeline constraints
- Existing customer research and insights

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Define Discovery Objectives

#### 1.1 Primary Learning Goals

**<critical_rule>Focus on outcomes and customer value, not solution validation</critical_rule>**

Answer these questions:

- [ ] What customer problems are we trying to understand?
- [ ] What decisions will this discovery inform?
- [ ] How will insights change our product strategy?
- [ ] What assumptions are we testing?

Example format:
"We want to understand [customer behavior/need] so we can [make informed decision] to achieve [business outcome]"

#### 1.2 Success Criteria

Define what good discovery looks like:

- [ ] Specific insights we need to uncover
- [ ] Quality of evidence required for decisions
- [ ] Timeline for gathering insights
- [ ] Coverage across customer segments

### 2. Map Research Questions

- [ ] What would make them switch from current approach?

#### 2.2 Solution Validation Questions

- [ ] How well does our proposed solution fit their workflow?
- [ ] What value would they expect from this solution?
- [ ] What concerns would they have about adoption?
- [ ] How would they measure success?
- [ ] What would make this a "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have"?

#### 2.3 Market Opportunity Questions

- [ ] How big is this problem for them?
