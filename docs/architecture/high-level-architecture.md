# High Level Architecture

## Technical Summary

The thinkhaven platform implements a **modern serverless-first architecture** with a dual-pane user interface for AI-powered strategic coaching. The architecture leverages Next.js 15's App Router for both frontend and API layers, integrating with Supabase for data persistence and real-time features, and Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.0 for AI coaching capabilities. The system follows a **component-based frontend architecture** with **API-first backend design**, enabling seamless AI conversation streaming while maintaining strategic business analysis capabilities through the integrated BMad Method framework.

## Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Vercel + Supabase
**Key Services:** Vercel Edge Functions, Supabase Database/Auth/Storage, Anthropic Claude API
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Global CDN with edge compute, multi-region database replication

**Rationale:** This combination provides optimal developer experience, automatic scaling, and integrated auth/database/real-time features perfect for AI-powered applications.

## Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with npm workspaces
**Monorepo Tool:** npm workspaces (built-in)
**Package Organization:** Apps (web), Packages (shared utilities), Framework definitions (.bmad-core)

## Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static generation with serverless APIs - _Rationale:_ Optimal performance and global distribution for AI chat applications
- **Component-Based UI:** Reusable React components with TypeScript - _Rationale:_ Maintainability and type safety across dual-pane interface
- **API-First Backend:** RESTful endpoints with streaming support - _Rationale:_ Enables real-time AI conversation while maintaining clean separation
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Server-Sent Events for real-time updates - _Rationale:_ Superior to WebSockets for AI streaming with built-in reconnection
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Clear separation between AI, BMad, and Workspace domains - _Rationale:_ Supports complex strategic coaching workflows
