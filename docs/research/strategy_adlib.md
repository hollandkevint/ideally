# You Can "Hear" Strategy

When is something strategic? What differentiates a non-strategy from an actual strategy? Much has been written on this topic, but I wanted to explore something very simple.

When you hear it, you know.

To explore this, I’ve written some mad libs for you to try with your team.

Note how in each of these mad libs there’s a bit of tension. There’s a decision. There’s contrast. You can’t just plop in fuzzy, feel-good language. You can’t “be all the things.” You can’t win by magically being good at everything. They’re sharp and pointed, and may even create some tension or discomfort. Another key characteristic: you could fill these in with very different options, and they’d still make sense.

Assignment #1: Can you fill these in for your company right now? Do you know? Have these perspectives been stated explicitly?

Assignment #2: Get a good group together. Have fun filling out wildly different alternatives for your company. Share what you learn.

We will differentiate based on our ability to ______________, not on our ability to ______________.

We admire [competitor]’s ability to ______________, but we’ve chosen not to challenge that head-on. That would be a losing proposition. Instead, we see an opportunity to ______________.

There are many things we do that are easy to copy, like ______________, ______________, and ______________. What we believe is hard to copy, however, is our ability to ______________.

Realistically, all of our key competitors have access to the same ________. What they struggle to access is ________. If we can defend this, we have a real shot at keeping them at bay.

A dominant position in ________ will make our lives much easier when it comes to ________. Without it, everything else becomes harder to pull off.

Like many of our competitors, we are riding the ______________ wave. It’s a tailwind for everyone, and we’re all trying to ______________. The unfair advantage we can exploit, however, is ______________.

We’re comfortable with ambiguity around ______________, and we’re fine delaying convergence on ______________ and ______________. Where we do need to make hard decisions in the near term is ______________, because ______________.

It’s a boring strategy, but we’re going to stay the course on ________ instead of chasing shinier, distracting plays like ________ and ________. This gives us leverage in ________, and we believe there’s still upside here we haven’t fully captured.

It’s going to be difficult, but for now it’s OK that we’re only passable at _______________. This is not where we expect to gain an edge right now.

We continue to operate on the core insight that _______________. We recognize this is controversial, and our competitors hold different views. For example, [competitor] believes _______________. But we’re sticking to our interpretation, as long as _______________.

Sure, we have to keep track of [normal KPIs], and in the current economic climate we need to pay special attention to ______________. But that only keeps us in the game. The contest will ultimately be decided by ______________ and ______________. The edge we want to pursue there is ______________, while consciously letting ______________ and ______________ go.

[Competitor] is locked into ______________. If they copied our approach to ______________, they would risk ______________. That gives us the opening to ______________.

We are undeniably strong in ________. We could play this card for a long time without any serious threat. But we anticipate a time when ________, and things will get a lot more challenging. To be ready for that, we’ll need to place longer-term bets on ________.

We will win in ______________ (customer segment / geography / category). We will not try to win in ______________, even if the temptation is there.

Many people—both externally and internally—believe the biggest threat to our business is _______________. This is understandable because _______________. But the missing link, in our view, is that _______________.

We recognize that ______________ is inevitable, driven by ______________. Competing as if this weren’t happening would lock us into ______________.

Our customers would love it if we could _______________. But if we do that without _______________, we will likely fall short of our commitment to them.

We are very aware that _______________, and we recognize the pressure to _____________. But we are deliberately deprioritizing that in the [time frame] because _______________. Ultimately, if we can’t ________________, our efforts now will jeopardize our ability to _______________.

Once customers choose us, they face significant friction if they try to ______________. That protects us from churn and allows us to ______________ without immediately triggering defection.

We have secured privileged access to ______________ (e.g., talent, data, partnerships). Without it, competitors will struggle to ______________, which keeps us ahead in ______________.

Our unit economics improve as ______________ increases. Competitors without this scale will face ______________, while we can reinvest in ______________.

The weak signals suggest that ______________ will soon commoditize. If we invest ahead of that curve, we can ______________ before others react.

Customers are locked into ______________ because of habit or structure. By offering ______________, we can exploit that inertia in our favor.

The big climatic force shaping our space is ______________ (e.g. efficiency drive, standardization, rising capital costs). It means that strategies based on ______________ are unlikely to hold, while ______________ becomes more viable.

As long as we don’t fall too far behind on _______________, we can catch up—provided we can _______________.

[Competitor] is extremely hard to beat when it comes to _______________. We can counter that by _______________.

Some of the things we are doing now are necessarily linear: we put money in and get reasonable returns out. But we see the opportunity for something high-leverage, with network effects, in _______________. If we don’t invest there, we risk getting stuck in a linear, hard-to-defend game.

Over time, we’ve developed unique know-how in ______________ that can’t be easily codified or copied. It enables us to consistently ______________ faster/cheaper/better than others.

We’ll accelerate the commoditization of ______________, knowing it undermines [competitor]’s advantage there.

We’ll protect ______________ by wrapping it with ______________ (data, ecosystem, integrations) so that even if the core commoditizes, our advantage remains.
