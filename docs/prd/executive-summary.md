# Executive Summary

**ThinkHaven** is a **decision accelerator** that applies structured methodology to validate or kill business ideas before users waste time building. Positioned as "More structured than Claude, faster than consultants, more strategic than Miro," the platform packages expert methodology into an AI system with genuine pushback and polished, portable outputs.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Primary Value**: Pressure-test ideas in 10-30 minutes with opinionated pushback that most AI tools don't provide
- **Target Users**: Builders/strategists who need to validate before committing, consultants who need structured deliverables fast
- **Differentiation**: Enforced methodology + sub-persona balancing + anti-sycophancy + kill recommendations when warranted
- **Key Outcomes**: Lean Canvas, PRD/Spec documents that travel to prototyping tools (Lovable, Replit, Claude, Figma)

## What ThinkHaven Is NOT

- A Claude wrapper with a persona
- A learning platform that teaches frameworks
- A project management tool
- A high-fidelity design tool
- Brainstorming without filtering

## The User Experience

Users should feel:
- **Challenged but confident** - Pressure-testing was useful and invigorating
- **Ready to build** - Clear direction on whether to invest time
- **Want to do it again** - Methodology creates momentum, not paralysis

**The magic is the feeling, not just the artifact.** Output is portable - it travels to the next tool in the workflow.

## Current Implementation Status (January 2026)

**Built:**
- Claude integration with streaming
- Mary persona (basic questioning styles)
- Session persistence and guest flow
- Credit system infrastructure
- Lean Canvas and partial spec/PRD generation

**Must Build for MVP:**
- Sub-persona balancing (Inquisitive → Devil's Advocate → Encouraging → Realistic)
- Anti-sycophancy / kill recommendation logic with viability scoring
- 10-message trial gate with partial output
- Full output polish

## Business Model

**Phase 1: Lifetime Deal** - $199-499 one-time (early adopters, cash + feedback)
**Phase 2: Subscription + Credits** - Monthly access with pay-as-you-go overflow

## 90-Day Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Acquisition | 100 signups |
| Activation | 50% complete session + output |
| Revenue | $2,000 |
| Retention | 75% return for 2nd session |

## Competitive Position

| Competitor | ThinkHaven's Edge |
|------------|-------------------|
| Claude (skills/projects) | Structured methodology + opinionated pushback + polished output |
| Strategy consultants | 10-30 min vs. weeks, $20 vs. $5K+, on-demand |
| Miro/Figjam/Balsamiq | Strategy-first with visuals as output, not canvas-first |

**Moat:** Enforced methodology + sub-persona balancing + anti-sycophancy + polished portable outputs. Hard to DIY.
