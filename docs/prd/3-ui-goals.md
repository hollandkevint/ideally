# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

### Primary UX Principles
The ideally.co interface embodies **"Intelligent Simplicity"** - providing sophisticated strategic thinking capabilities through an intuitive, uncluttered dual-pane experience that feels like collaborating with an expert strategic advisor.

**Core Experience Goals:**
- **Conversational Fluidity:** AI interactions feel natural and responsive, like talking with a knowledgeable business advisor
- **Visual Integration:** Seamless flow between conversation and visual ideation without cognitive overhead
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex strategic frameworks revealed gradually based on user engagement and session progression
- **Confident Guidance:** Interface provides clear direction and next steps while maintaining user agency in strategic decisions

### User Mental Model
Users should experience the platform as a **"Strategic Thinking Partner"** rather than a tool:
- Left pane feels like talking to Mary, a strategic business analyst
- Right pane feels like collaborative whiteboarding with intelligent assistance
- Transitions between modes feel natural and contextually appropriate
- Session progression feels structured but not rigid

## Key Interaction Paradigms

### Dual-Pane Coordination
- **Contextual Bridging:** Ideas mentioned in conversation automatically suggest visual representations
- **Bi-directional Flow:** Canvas changes inform conversation context and vice versa
- **Synchronized State:** Pane focus and content stay logically connected throughout session

### Conversational Interface Patterns
- **Numbered Response Options:** Clear 1-9 choice format for structured decision making
