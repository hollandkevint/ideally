## Background Context

### Product Vision
The ideally.co platform combines the proven bMAD Method foundation with an innovative dual-pane interface that revolutionizes how strategic thinking happens. Drawing from the success of strategy consultants who transformed $15K engagements into $50K validated outcomes, this platform addresses the core problem: current AI tools provide unstructured conversations while traditional tools lack intelligence.

### Current State Reality
The platform currently exists as a sophisticated **Next.js 15 application with foundational architecture**, including:
- Working Supabase authentication system
- Comprehensive database schema designed for AI integration
- Dual-pane workspace foundation with CSS framework
- Professional monorepo structure with proper module organization

**Critical Gap**: The platform lacks actual Claude Sonnet 4 integration - current "Mary" AI responses are hardcoded simulations in `workspace/[id]/page.tsx:104-110` requiring immediate replacement with real AI capabilities.

### Key Platform Features
- **Adaptive AI Persona:** Transparently evolves during sessions from initial brainstorming through strategic validation
- **Dual-Pane Experience:** Conversational coaching (left) + visual canvas (right) for wireframing, Mermaid diagrams, and concept iteration
- **Choose-Your-Adventure Flow:** Users select their ideation path (new idea, business model problem, feature refinement) with tailored coaching approaches
- **Open-Source Extensibility:** Community-driven coaching patterns and techniques beyond bMAD foundation

### Target Users
**Primary Users** (validated through strategy consultant insights):
- **Independent Consultants** seeking to scale from 2 to 10+ clients monthly through structured workflows
- **Entrepreneurs** validating ideas before significant investment, reducing pivot time from months to weeks
- **Product Managers** facilitating strategic planning sessions with visual documentation capabilities

**Secondary Users**:
- **Professional Coaches** delivering structured client sessions with exportable outcomes
- **Corporate Innovation Teams** conducting rapid ideation with integrated visualization tools

### Market Position
This represents a new category: **"Strategic Thinking Workspace"** - combining probabilistic exploration (AI) with deterministic structure (workflows) and visual iteration capabilities, enabling users to move from raw ideas to validated business concepts in structured 30-minute sessions.
