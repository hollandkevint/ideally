## v6.0 Key Changes (January 2026)

### Positioning Shift
- **From:** "AI Product Coaching Platform" / "30-minute product coach"
- **To:** "Decision Accelerator" / "More structured than Claude, faster than consultants"

### Core Differentiator: Sub-Persona System
All sessions now include four modes (weighted by pathway):
1. **Inquisitive** - Dig deeper, understand context
2. **Devil's Advocate** - Challenge assumptions, red-team
3. **Encouraging** - Validate good instincts
4. **Realistic** - Ground in constraints

### Anti-Sycophancy by Design
- Kill decision framework with escalating honesty
- Will recommend killing ideas when warranted
- Viability scoring with clear reasoning

### MVP Focus
- Output: Lean Canvas + PRD/Spec (portable to prototyping tools)
- Canvas/visuals: Nice-to-have, not critical for MVP
- Trial: 10 messages with partial output at gate

### Success Metrics
| Metric | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------------|
| Acquisition | 100 signups |
| Activation | 50% |
| Revenue | $2,000 |
| Retention | 75% |
