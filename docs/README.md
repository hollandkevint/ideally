## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Documentation Status Warning**

**DO NOT USE ARCHIVED DOCUMENTATION FOR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT**

The following documents are **OUTDATED** and reflect pre-deployment state:
- ❌ `archive/outdated-implementation-docs/TECHNICAL-GUIDE.md` - Claims Claude integration "missing"
- ❌ `archive/outdated-implementation-docs/IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` - Treats working features as TODO
- ❌ `archive/historical/stories/` - Describes implemented features as aspirational

**These documents suggest the platform needs basic AI integration when it's actually a complete BMad Method strategic coaching system.**
