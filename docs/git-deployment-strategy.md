### Push Strategy

#### Option 1: Direct Push (Recommended for mockup)
```bash
# Push all commits to main branch
git push origin main

# This will:
# - Update the repository with enhanced landing page
# - Make deployment documentation available
# - Trigger any existing CI/CD pipelines
```

#### Option 2: Feature Branch (More Conservative)
```bash
# Create feature branch for landing page updates
git checkout -b feature/landing-page-mockup

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/landing-page-mockup

# Create pull request for review before merging
# Allows for feedback before deployment
```

### Deployment Execution Plan

#### Phase 1: Immediate Deployment (Mockup Mode)
1. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Execute commits 1 and 2 above
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Quick Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Test current build locally
   cd apps/web
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Share with Kevin**:
   - Repository URL: `https://github.com/username/ideally.co`
   - Live preview via development server
   - Documentation in `docs/` folder

#### Phase 2: GitHub Pages Setup (Next Steps)
1. **Configure Static Export** (as per deployment plan)
2. **Set up GitHub Actions** workflow
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Test deployment** and verify all features work

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### Potential Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Next.js app may have dependencies that break static export
   - **Mitigation**: Test build locally first, document any issues
   
2. **Authentication Dependencies**: Current app uses Supabase
   - **Mitigation**: Landing page works for non-authenticated users
   
3. **API Route Dependencies**: Static export doesn't support API routes  
   - **Mitigation**: Landing page doesn't require API routes

#### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# If issues arise, revert landing page changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Or reset to previous working state
git reset --hard HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```
