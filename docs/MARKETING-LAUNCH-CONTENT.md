### Post 1: Assessment Launch (Day 1)

**Hook:** Problem-focused, relatable frustration

```
You have the data.
You have the experience.
You have the pressure to make the right call.

But somehow strategic decisions still feel like educated guesses.

I built a free 5-minute assessment to show you why — and what to do about it.

It measures three areas where most strategic thinkers struggle:
→ Evidence-based decision making (gut feeling vs. data)
→ Framework mastery (ad-hoc vs. systematic thinking)
→ Actionable outputs (analysis paralysis vs. executable plans)

Takes 5 minutes. Instant personalized results. No signup required.

After 300+ hours building strategic thinking tools, I've learned that most people don't lack intelligence or data — they lack systematic frameworks for processing that data into decisions.

This assessment tells you exactly where you are and what to work on next.

Try it, share your results in the comments (if you're comfortable), and let me know if it resonates.

### Post 2: Behind the Scenes (Day 3)

**Hook:** Building in public, vulnerability

```
I just launched a strategic thinking assessment.

48 hours later: 23 completions, 8 signups, and feedback that's both encouraging and humbling.

Here's what I'm learning in real-time:

Most common score: 3.2/5.0 on evidence-based thinking
• People HAVE data but don't know how to systematically use it
• "I feel like I'm guessing even when I have numbers" came up 6 times

Biggest surprise: Framework mastery scored HIGHER than I expected
• Average 3.7/5.0
• But actionable outputs scored lowest (2.9/5.0)
• Translation: People can analyze, but struggle to turn analysis into action

What I got wrong:
• Initially made quiz 25 questions → got feedback it was too long
• Cut to 15 questions, completion rate jumped 40%
• Lesson: Respect people's time, even when offering value

The assessment is part of ThinkHaven — an AI coach that helps you work through strategic challenges using proven frameworks. After you take the assessment, you get 2 free coaching sessions to test it out.

If you took it already: THANK YOU. Your feedback is shaping how this evolves.

If you haven't: Try it and let me know what you think.

Building in public is uncomfortable. But it's the fastest way to build something people actually want.

### Post 3: Use Case Stories (Day 7)

**Hook:** Specific, relatable scenario

```
"I had all the customer research. All the competitive analysis. All the data.

But when my CEO asked 'So what should we do?' I froze."

This is from someone who took the ThinkHaven assessment last week.

Scored 4.2/5.0 on evidence gathering.
Scored 2.1/5.0 on turning analysis into action.

The problem wasn't lack of intelligence or data.
The problem was lack of systematic frameworks for processing that data into recommendations.

Here's what happened after 2 coaching sessions:

Instead of presenting 47 slides of research, they created:
→ A one-page decision framework
→ Three scenarios with clear trade-offs
→ A recommended path with success criteria
→ Contingency plans for each risk

Same data. Different framework. Completely different outcome.

The CEO's response: "This is exactly what I needed. When can we start?"

Strategic thinking isn't about being smarter.
It's about having better frameworks for processing what you already know.

Want to see where your frameworks have gaps?
Take the free assessment: https://thinkhaven.co/assessment

Then try 2 free coaching sessions to work through a real challenge.

No strings attached. Just honest feedback about whether this is useful.

### Post 4: Contrarian Take (Day 10)

**Hook:** Challenge conventional wisdom

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most strategic planning is just expensive guessing with PowerPoint.

You gather data → Hold workshops → Create frameworks → Build roadmaps

Then reality hits and none of it matters because you didn't test your assumptions.

I've seen this in healthcare, tech, consulting, and startups.

The problem isn't the quality of your analysis.
The problem is treating strategy as a document instead of a testable hypothesis.

Here's what works better:

1. State your strategy as falsifiable assumptions
   ❌ "We'll increase engagement"
   ✅ "If we reduce onboarding steps from 7 to 3, signups completing setup will increase 25%+"

2. Design cheap tests BEFORE big investments
   ❌ Build the whole feature
   ✅ Run a landing page test with fake door

3. Define what would prove you WRONG
   ❌ "We'll know it's working when metrics improve"
   ✅ "If <metric X> doesn't improve by <Y%> in <Z weeks>, our assumption is wrong"

4. Update your strategy based on evidence
   ❌ "The strategy is sound, we just need more time"
   ✅ "Assumption #2 failed, here's what we learned and how we're adapting"

Strategy = hypothesis. Execution = experiment. Results = data.

Everything else is just storytelling.

I built ThinkHaven to help people think this way systematically.

5-10 people to try it and tell me honestly:
• Is this valuable for your work?

Building in public moment:

I've spent the last few months creating an AI strategic thinking coach for PMs.

**The problem I'm trying to solve:**
You have data, experience, and pressure — but strategic decisions still feel like educated guesses. Most frameworks don't actually help when you're stuck.

**What I built:**
→ Free assessment to identify your strategic thinking gaps (5 min)
→ AI coach that walks you through systematic frameworks
→ Outputs professional briefs you can share with stakeholders

**What I need:**
5-10 product people to try it and give brutal honesty:
• Did this actually help, or is it just another AI chatbot?
• Would you pay for this? How much?
• What's missing that would make it indispensable?

You get 2 free sessions (20-30 min each). No credit card, no strings.

Think "ChatGPT meets JTBD/Lean Canvas/Strategy frameworks" — trying to figure out if this is useful enough to build as a real product.

Start with the assessment:

Hey [Name],

Saw you completed both sessions — thank you!

Would love 2 minutes of your time for quick feedback:

1. **Rating (1-5):** How valuable was this compared to other strategic thinking tools you've used?

2. **Would you pay?** If yes, what feels fair? ($10/session? $50 for 5 sessions? $200/month unlimited?)

3. **What's missing?** What would make this 10x more useful for your work?

Hit reply with quick answers — even "this didn't work for me because..." is super valuable.

If you found it useful and want more sessions, I'm planning to launch paid plans in 2-3 weeks. Happy to give you early-bird pricing as a thank you for testing.

### Email 2: Framework Education (3 days after assessment if no signup)

**Subject:** Why strategic decisions feel like guessing (even when you have data)

```
Hi [Name],

You took the strategic thinking assessment a few days ago.

Your results showed [strongest area] was solid, but [weakest area] had room for improvement.

Here's why that happens:

Most strategic thinkers are great at gathering information. They do the research, talk to customers, analyze competitors, review data.

But when it's time to make a decision, they hit a wall.

The problem isn't lack of intelligence or data.
The problem is lack of systematic frameworks for processing that data into decisions.

**Example:**
You're deciding whether to build Feature A or Feature B.

**Without a framework, it sounds like:**
"I think Feature A might be better because users mentioned it more, but Feature B could open new markets, and my gut says... I don't know."

**With a framework (like ICE scoring), it looks like:**
Feature A: Impact 8, Confidence 7, Ease 4 = Score 19
Feature B: Impact 6, Confidence 5, Ease 8 = Score 19

Wait, they're tied! Now let's apply RICE (adds Reach):
Feature A: Reach 1000 users, RICE = 140
Feature B: Reach 5000 users, RICE = 200

Decision: Feature B. Here's why. Here are the risks. Here's how we'll measure success.

Same data. Same intuition. But the framework gives you:
→ A clear rationale you can defend
→ Criteria for making the call
→ A process you can repeat

That's what ThinkHaven helps you do systematically.

Work through a real challenge. See if frameworks beat guessing.

Kevin

P.S. If you tried it already and I missed it, apologies! Let me know what you thought.

### Email 3: Social Proof (7 days after assessment if no signup)

**Subject:** "This is exactly what I needed" - Early feedback from testers

```
Hi [Name],

Quick update: 23 people have now tried ThinkHaven's coaching sessions.

Here's what they're saying:

**"This forced me to think through assumptions I didn't even know I was making."**
— Sarah, Product Manager at health tech startup

**"I've used consultants for strategic planning. This was faster and more actionable."**
— Michael, VP Product at mid-size SaaS company

**"The best part was the document it generated. I sent it straight to my CEO."**
— Jennifer, Founder of B2B analytics company

The pattern I'm seeing:
People don't need more information. They need better frameworks for processing the information they have.

You already took the assessment and saw where your frameworks have gaps.

Want to try closing those gaps with your 2 free coaching sessions?
🔗 https://thinkhaven.co

20-30 minutes each. Work through real challenges.

If it's not useful, no worries — just let me know why so I can improve it.

Kevin

P.S. Only 5 spots left for early testers before I start charging. After that, you'll still get the first 2 sessions free, but figured you'd want the "I tested this before it was cool" bragging rights. 😊

## Response Templates (Common Questions/Objections)

### "I don't have time right now"

```
Totally understand! The assessment link doesn't expire, so bookmark it for when you need strategic thinking help.

Most people find it useful when they're stuck on a specific decision and need a framework to work through it.

Just keep https://thinkhaven.co/assessment in your back pocket for that moment. 🙂
```

---

### "What will this cost later?"

```
Great question — I'm still figuring that out based on feedback from early testers.

Likely something like:
• $20-30 per session, or
• $50 for a 5-pack, or
• $200/month for unlimited

Your feedback after trying the free sessions will actually help me set the right price.

What seems fair to you for strategic coaching that takes 20-30 minutes and gives you shareable documents?
```

---

### "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

```
Fair question! I've thought about this a lot.

**ChatGPT:**
→ Gives you whatever answer you ask for
→ No structure, you're responsible for knowing what to ask
→ Easy to go in circles or get generic advice

**ThinkHaven:**
→ Guides you through proven frameworks step-by-step
→ Asks you the questions you SHOULD be asking yourself
→ Forces you to work through assumptions you might skip
→ Outputs structured documents (Lean Canvas, Feature Briefs, etc.)

It's like the difference between:
• Having access to Google (ChatGPT), vs
• Having a coach who asks the right questions in the right order (ThinkHaven)

The frameworks are the key. I've just automated the coaching process.

Try it and let me know if that distinction actually matters in practice:
https://thinkhaven.co
```

---

### "Can I share this with my team?"

```
Absolutely! Each person can sign up and get their own 2 free sessions.

Actually, that would be a great test:
→ Have your team each try a session independently
→ Compare the outputs in your next strategy meeting
→ See if it helps alignment or surfaces different assumptions

Let me know how that goes if you try it!
```
