# Story 1.1: Platform Rebranding to Thinkhaven

## Status
Closed - Production Deployed

## Story
**As a** platform user,  
**I want** the application to be fully rebranded to "Thinkhaven" with consistent naming and domain references,  
**so that** I experience a cohesive brand identity that matches the new domain and project naming.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. All user-facing text displays "Thinkhaven" instead of "Strategic Workspace" or "Ideally.co"
2. App metadata (title, description) reflects Thinkhaven branding  
3. Authentication flows redirect to thinkhaven.co domain URLs
4. Navigation and UI components show consistent Thinkhaven branding

### Integration Requirements
5. Existing authentication functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New branding follows existing component and layout patterns  
7. Integration with Supabase and Vercel maintains current behavior with updated project names

### Quality Requirements
8. All tests updated to reflect new branding expectations
9. Documentation updated to reference Thinkhaven instead of ideally.co
10. No regression in existing authentication, navigation, or core functionality verified

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This is the first story, implementing brand consistency following the naming analysis that selected "Thinkhaven" as the platform name.

### Architecture Integration Points

**Frontend Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]**
- Component organization follows established patterns under `apps/web/app/components/`
- Update text content in existing components without changing component structure  
- Use established metadata patterns from current layout.tsx structure
- Follow existing branding patterns in layouts, auth pages, and navigation components

**Tech Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- Next.js 15.5.0 App Router with TypeScript 5.x for type safety
- React 19.1.0 with existing component patterns maintained
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 following existing design system patterns
- Supabase Auth 2.56.0 with updated redirect configurations

**Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- App metadata: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`
- Auth pages: `apps/web/app/login/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/signup/page.tsx`  
- Navigation: `apps/web/app/components/ui/navigation.tsx`
- Landing page: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
- Dashboard: `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Environment config: `apps/web/.env.local`, `apps/web/.env.example`

**Integration Approach**
- Update metadata and branding strings in existing components without changing component structure
- Environment variables updated to reference thinkhaven.co domain  
- Follow existing patterns for text content and brand presentation
- Preserve current component architecture and styling

**Key Constraints**
- Maintain all existing functionality during rebrand
- Preserve current component architecture and styling patterns  
- Keep same authentication flow behavior with updated redirect URLs
- No breaking changes to existing APIs (text-only changes)

### Testing

**Test File Locations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- Component tests: `tests/components/auth/`, `tests/components/ui/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/auth-flow.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/landing-page.spec.ts`

**Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- Frontend Testing: Vitest 3.2.4 for component unit testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright for end-to-end user flows
- Test expected text updates in existing test files
- Verify no functional regression in authentication and navigation flows

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Test that all user-facing text shows "Thinkhaven" instead of "Strategic Workspace"
- Verify metadata changes appear in browser title and descriptions
- Test authentication flows with updated redirect URLs
- Validate navigation components display new branding consistently
