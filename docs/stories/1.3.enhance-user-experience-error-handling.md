## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Story 1.1:** Database reliability should be established, providing stable backend foundation.
**From Story 1.2:** UI state management should be improved, enabling better user experience flows.

### User Experience Issues Identified
[Source: User testing feedback from epic context and localhost testing logs]

**Specific UX Problems to Address:**
1. **Poor Strategic Guidance:** "Didn't give direction within a session when Kevin clicked the session tag"
2. **Low Confidence Issues:** "Only 30% confidence interval, seems far too low for some initial directions"
3. **Lack of Context:** "Should follow up with more context as needed, then analyze and give clear direction"
4. **Missing Onboarding:** Users don't understand BMad Method framework on first use
5. **Generic Errors:** "Unknown error" messages provide no actionable guidance

### Component Enhancement Areas
[Source: Analysis of apps/web/app/components/bmad/ components]

**Primary Components for Enhancement:**
- **ElicitationPanel** - Needs better strategic guidance and confidence scoring
- **SessionManager** - Requires improved progress tracking and session controls
- **PathwaySelector** - Should provide better pathway explanations and confidence
- **BmadInterface** - Needs comprehensive error boundaries and loading states

**Current Implementation Gaps:**
- Minimal error handling beyond basic try/catch blocks
- No loading states for async operations
- Limited user guidance and contextual help
- Generic success/failure messaging without specificity

### Error Handling Architecture
[Source: Current error patterns in API and components]

**Current Error Handling Patterns:**
- API errors: Basic console.error with generic user messages
- Component errors: Minimal error boundaries, often causing blank screens
- Session errors: Simple error state without recovery options
- Database errors: Generic "Unknown error" from backend operations

**Required Error Handling Improvements:**
- **Specific Error Types:** Database connection, session creation, pathway analysis failures
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Replace technical errors with actionable guidance
- **Recovery Mechanisms:** Retry buttons, alternative pathways, graceful degradation
- **Error Boundaries:** Prevent component crashes from affecting entire interface

### Loading State Implementation
[Source: Current loading patterns in workspace and BMad components]

**Current Loading Implementation:**
- Basic `loading` boolean states in components
- Simple "Loading..." text without visual indicators
- Inconsistent loading UX across different operations
- No skeleton screens or progressive loading

**Enhanced Loading Requirements:**
- **Visual Indicators:** Spinners, progress bars, skeleton screens
- **Contextual Feedback:** "Creating your strategic session...", "Analyzing pathway options..."
- **Progress Tracking:** Percentage complete, estimated time remaining
- **Consistent Patterns:** Unified loading component library

### User Guidance and Onboarding
[Source: BMad Method framework requirements and user feedback]

**BMad Method Framework Context:**
- 3 strategic pathways: New idea, Business model, Strategic optimization
- Interactive elicitation with numbered options (1-9)
- Phase-based progression with specific outcomes
- 30-minute structured strategic thinking sessions

**Onboarding Requirements:**
- **Framework Introduction:** What is BMad Method and how it helps
- **Pathway Selection Guidance:** When to choose each pathway
- **Session Flow Overview:** What to expect during a strategic session
