# SP.2: Define Single Urgent Use Case - Startup Idea Validation

## Status
**Ready** - Critical for positioning

## Priority
**P0 - Immediate** - Must define before marketing spend

## Context
The critical analysis identified that ThinkHaven lacks a "hair on fire" use case. We're selling "strategic thinking" to people who think they're already good at it.

**The Insight:**
> "Pick ONE urgent use case: Validate your startup idea in 30 minutes before you waste 6 months"

**Why Idea Validation:**
- High stakes ($50K+ savings if idea is bad)
- Time-sensitive (founders want to move fast)
- Clear outcome (validated/invalidated + next steps)
- Matches existing New Idea pathway

## Story
**As a** founder with a startup idea,
**I want** to validate my concept in 30 minutes with structured analysis,
**so that** I don't waste months building something nobody wants.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clear Value Proposition**: Landing page leads with "Validate your idea before wasting $50K"
2. **30-Minute Promise**: Session completes in 30 minutes or less
3. **Structured Validation**: Mary asks the 10 critical questions every idea needs
4. **Binary Outcome**: Clear "Validated" / "Needs Work" / "Pivot" recommendation
5. **Shareable Output**: PDF that founder can show co-founders, advisors, investors
6. **Next Steps**: Concrete actions based on validation result

1. **Problem Clarity**: Is the problem specific and painful?
2. **Target Customer**: Who exactly has this problem?
3. **Market Size**: How many people have this problem?
4. **Urgency**: Why would someone pay to solve this TODAY?
5. **Current Solutions**: What do people do now?
6. **Your Solution**: What's your approach?
7. **Differentiation**: Why is this 10x better?
8. **Validation Evidence**: Have you talked to customers?
9. **Business Model**: How will you make money?
10. **Founder Fit**: Why are you the right person to build this?

### Scoring

## Dev Notes

### Key Differentiator from ChatGPT
ChatGPT will answer questions. ThinkHaven will:
1. Ask the RIGHT questions in the RIGHT order
2. Score answers against a proven framework
3. Produce a professional, shareable output
4. Give a clear recommendation (not just "it depends")

### Competitive Positioning
- vs. ChatGPT: Structured + scored + output
- vs. Notion templates: AI-powered + personalized
- vs. Consulting: 30 min + $99 vs. weeks + $15K
