# Story 5.1: Business Model Assumption Testing Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** platform owner validating market assumptions,
**I want** automated tracking of key hypotheses (pricing acceptance, session completion rates, repeat usage),
**so that** I can make data-driven decisions about product-market fit with statistical confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Core Assumption Tracking**: Automated measurement of critical business model hypotheses with statistical confidence intervals
2. **Key Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of assumption validation status with trend analysis

4. **Market Validation Alerts**: Automated notifications when assumptions reach statistical significance or require attention
5. **Data-Driven Decision Support**: Comprehensive reporting system that enables evidence-based product-market fit decisions
