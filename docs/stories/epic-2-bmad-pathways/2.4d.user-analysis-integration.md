## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Can be used with any of Stories 2.4a-2.4c**: UCD analysis is designed as optional enhancement that can integrate at any point in feature refinement workflow.

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.4a-2.4c: Session management patterns work well for optional workflow steps. AI analysis and brief generation patterns established and can be extended for UCD insights.

### Data Models
**User-Centered Design Analysis Schema** [Source: Epic 2 simplified for optional integration]:
```sql
-- Extend existing feature_input_data in bmad_sessions
{
  "feature_description": "string",
  "priority_scoring": { /* from 2.4b */ },
  "feature_brief": { /* from 2.4c */ },
  "ucd_analysis": {
    "enabled": "boolean",
    "target_personas": ["string"],
    "persona_alignment_score": "number (1-5)",
    "accessibility_considerations": ["string"],
    "accessibility_impact": "number (1-5)",
    "inclusive_design_notes": ["string"],
    "user_validation_questions": ["string"],
    "analysis_timestamp": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

**TypeScript Interface**:
```typescript
interface UCDAnalysis {
  enabled: boolean;
  target_personas: string[];
  persona_alignment_score: number; // 1-5
  accessibility_considerations: string[];
  accessibility_impact: number; // 1-5
  inclusive_design_notes: string[];
  user_validation_questions: string[];
  analysis_timestamp: Date;
}

interface AccessibilityCheckpoint {
  category: 'Visual' | 'Motor' | 'Cognitive' | 'Hearing';
  consideration: string;
  impact_level: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
  recommendation: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
**UCD Analysis Endpoint** [Source: following /api/bmad pattern]:
- `POST /api/bmad` with `action: 'analyze_user_needs'`
- Request: `{ feature_description: string, target_users: string, session_id: string }`
- Response: `{ ucd_analysis: UCDAnalysis, accessibility_checkpoints: AccessibilityCheckpoint[] }`

**Claude Integration for UCD Analysis**:
```typescript
const UCD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
Analyze this feature from a user-centered design perspective:

Feature: {{feature_description}}
Target Users: {{target_users}}

Provide:
1. Persona alignment assessment (how well this feature serves the target users)
2. 3-5 accessibility considerations (visual, motor, cognitive, hearing)
3. Inclusive design recommendations
4. User validation questions to test assumptions

Focus on practical, actionable insights for product development.
`;
```

### Component Specifications
**New Components Required** [Source: unified-project-structure.md]:
- `/apps/web/app/components/bmad/pathways/UCDAnalysis.tsx` - Optional UCD analysis interface

- `/apps/web/app/components/bmad/pathways/PersonaAlignment.tsx` - Persona validation component

**Enhanced Components**:
- `/apps/web/app/components/bmad/pathways/FeatureRefinementPathway.tsx` - Add optional UCD step
- `/apps/web/app/components/bmad/pathways/FeatureBriefGenerator.tsx` - Include UCD insights when available

### File Locations
**New Files to Create** [Source: unified-project-structure.md]:
- `/apps/web/lib/bmad/analysis/user-centered-design.ts` - UCD analysis logic
- `/apps/web/lib/bmad/frameworks/accessibility-guidelines.ts` - WCAG-based checking
- `/apps/web/lib/bmad/utils/persona-validation.ts` - Persona alignment utilities

- `/apps/web/lib/bmad/generators/feature-brief-generator.ts` - Include UCD insights in brief
- `/apps/web/lib/bmad/types.ts` - Add UCDAnalysis and AccessibilityCheckpoint types

### Technical Implementation Details
**UCD Analysis Flow** [Source: Epic 2 optional enhancement]:
1. **Persona Alignment (2 minutes)**: Simple questions about target user fit
2. **Accessibility Review (2 minutes)**: Quick WCAG-based consideration checklist
3. **Inclusive Design (1 minute)**: Cognitive and physical accessibility notes
4. **Integration (1 minute)**: Add insights to existing feature brief

**Accessibility Framework** [Source: WCAG 2.1 simplified]:
```typescript
const ACCESSIBILITY_CATEGORIES = {
  Visual: ['Color contrast', 'Text scaling', 'Screen reader compatibility'],
  Motor: ['Keyboard navigation', 'Touch target size', 'Gesture alternatives'],
  Cognitive: ['Clear language', 'Error prevention', 'Consistent navigation'],
  Hearing: ['Captions', 'Visual alerts', 'Text alternatives for audio']
};

const assessAccessibilityImpact = (feature: string): AccessibilityCheckpoint[] => {
  // Simple rule-based assessment based on feature keywords
  // Returns relevant accessibility considerations
};
```

### Performance Requirements
**UCD Analysis Performance** [Source: Epic 2 optional enhancement]:
- UCD analysis generation: <8 seconds
- Accessibility assessment: <5 seconds
- Brief integration: <3 seconds
- Total optional step duration: 6 minutes maximum

### Integration Flexibility
**Workflow Integration Points**:
- **During Feature Input (2.4a)**: Add UCD analysis as optional next step
- **After Priority Scoring (2.4b)**: Enhance high-priority features with UCD analysis
- **Before Brief Generation (2.4c)**: Add UCD insights to improve brief quality
- **Post-Brief Enhancement**: Add UCD analysis to existing completed briefs

**Session State Management**:
- UCD analysis can be enabled/disabled without affecting other workflow steps
- Partial UCD data preserved if user exits mid-analysis
- Brief regeneration includes UCD insights when available
- UCD analysis can be modified and updated independently

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `/apps/web/tests/components/bmad/pathways/ucd-analysis/`
- Integration tests: `/apps/web/tests/integration/ucd-integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `/apps/web/tests/e2e/optional-ucd-workflow.test.ts`

**Specific Test Scenarios**:
- Optional UCD analysis enable/disable functionality
- Accessibility assessment accuracy with different feature types
- Persona alignment scoring with various user descriptions
- Brief integration when UCD analysis is present vs absent
- Workflow flexibility testing (adding UCD at different points)
- Performance testing for optional analysis generation

### Technical Constraints
**Simplified Scope for MVP**:
- No comprehensive persona library or management
- No advanced accessibility testing integration
- No user research methodology beyond basic validation questions
- No integration with external UX tools or user testing platforms
- Basic WCAG guidelines only, not comprehensive accessibility audit

**Optional Enhancement Design**:
- Must not disrupt core feature refinement workflow when disabled
- Should provide clear value proposition when offered to users
- Integration with brief must be seamless regardless of UCD analysis presence
- Performance impact minimal when UCD analysis is skipped

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Integration Tests**: `/apps/web/tests/integration/`
- **E2E Tests**: `/apps/web/tests/e2e/` with Playwright
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% for UCD analysis logic and integration points

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Optional workflow step integration testing across all feature refinement stages
- Accessibility assessment generation with various feature categories
- Persona alignment scoring accuracy with different user descriptions
- Brief enhancement testing when UCD analysis is present vs absent
- Session state management testing for optional UCD data
- Performance testing ensuring minimal impact when UCD analysis is disabled
