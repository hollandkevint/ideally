# Story 5.1: Business Model Assumption Testing Framework

## Status
**FUTURE** - Planned for Epic 5 (requires Epic 4 Monetization completion)

> **Note**: This story was moved from epic-2-bmad-pathways to epic-5-analytics on 2025-12-16 as part of story reorganization. It depends on Epic 4 (Monetization) being fully implemented to provide the payment and conversion data needed for assumption testing.

## Story

**As a** platform owner validating market assumptions,
**I want** automated tracking of key hypotheses (pricing acceptance, session completion rates, repeat usage),
**so that** I can make data-driven decisions about product-market fit with statistical confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Core Assumption Tracking**: Automated measurement of critical business model hypotheses with statistical confidence intervals
2. **Key Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of assumption validation status with trend analysis
3. **Hypothesis Testing Framework**: A/B testing infrastructure for validating pricing, feature adoption, and user behavior assumptions
4. **Market Validation Alerts**: Automated notifications when assumptions reach statistical significance or require attention
5. **Data-Driven Decision Support**: Comprehensive reporting system that enables evidence-based product-market fit decisions
