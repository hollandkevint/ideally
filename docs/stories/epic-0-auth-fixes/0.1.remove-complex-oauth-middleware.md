2. OAuth callback route `/app/auth/callback/route.ts` removed or disabled  
3. Existing redirect loop prevention measures implemented
4. Authentication-related middleware simplified to bare minimum

### Integration Requirements  
5. Existing Supabase database connections preserved unchanged
6. User management and RLS policies remain functional
7. No breaking changes to existing API endpoints (non-auth)

### Quality Requirements
8. All authentication-related tests updated or temporarily disabled

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This is the first story in Epic 0, addressing the critical authentication foundation issues identified in the Sprint Change Proposal. The authentication system currently experiences infinite redirect loops (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`) preventing all user access.

### Architecture Integration Points

**Backend Architecture [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]**
- Current middleware located at `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` contains auth flow logic
- Authentication flow diagram shows User→Frontend→SupabaseAuth→APIRoute→Database pattern
- Middleware/Guards section provides current implementation using `createServerClient` 
- Next.js API routes use serverless architecture with integrated auth verification

**Tech Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- Next.js 15.5.0 App Router with integrated API endpoints
- Supabase Auth 2.56.0 for user management and sessions
- TypeScript 5.x for full-stack type safety across middleware components
- Vercel deployment with serverless function support for middleware

**Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- Middleware location: `apps/web/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
- Auth callback routes: `apps/web/app/api/auth/` directory structure
- Authentication context: `apps/web/lib/auth/` directory
- Root middleware: `apps/web/middleware.ts` (Next.js convention)

**Integration Approach**
- Remove complex OAuth PKCE flow components without affecting database layer
- Preserve Supabase client initialization patterns for future Google signin integration  
- Maintain existing API endpoint structure while removing auth middleware complexity
- Keep RLS policies active but temporarily bypass middleware auth checks

**Key Constraints**
- Must not break existing Supabase database connections or user data access
- Preserve all non-authentication functionality during middleware removal
- Maintain ability to rollback changes if simplified approach fails
- Document all removed components for potential future reference

### Testing

**Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- Test file locations: `tests/api/auth/` for auth endpoint tests
- Testing framework: Vitest 3.2.4 for both unit and integration tests
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/auth-flow.test.ts` for authentication flows
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` for cross-system auth testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Temporarily disable auth-related tests in `tests/api/auth/` directory
- Skip E2E authentication flow tests until new Google signin implemented  
- Preserve database connection tests to ensure Supabase integration intact
- Add temporary tests for redirect loop prevention measures

**Test File Locations**
- Auth middleware tests: `tests/lib/supabase/middleware.test.ts` (disable)
- Auth callback tests: `tests/api/auth/callback.test.ts` (disable)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts` (disable)

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements**
- Application startup time should improve with simplified middleware
- Remove complex auth token verification reducing serverless function cold starts
- Maintain database query performance while preserving RLS policies

**Security Considerations**
- Temporarily disable auth protection while maintaining data isolation through RLS
- Ensure removal doesn't expose sensitive user data or API endpoints
- Document security implications of temporary auth bypass for development

### File Locations
**Primary Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Main middleware removal/simplification
- `apps/web/middleware.ts` - Root Next.js middleware configuration  
- `apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback route (remove if exists)
- `apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - May need updates for simplified flow

**Files to Preserve:**
- `apps/web/lib/supabase/client.ts` - Client-side Supabase setup
- `apps/web/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Server-side Supabase setup
- Database schema and RLS policies - No changes needed

### Debug Log References
Task 1.1 Analysis: Documented existing middleware functions in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts:4-106`

### Completion Notes List
Task 1.1: Analyzed complex middleware structure with manual auth cookie checking, redirect logic, and temporarily disabled authenticated user redirects (lines 88-95)
Task 1.3: Mapped middleware dependencies - core flow from middleware.ts→updateSession()→createServerClient with AuthContext.tsx client-side integration
Task 1.4: Identified redirect loop root cause as server/client auth state conflict between middleware verification and OAuth callback completion
Task 2: Disabled complex OAuth middleware - commented out manual auth cookie logic and redirect loops in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts:34-83`
Task 3: No OAuth callback routes found to remove - confirmed none exist in `/app/auth/` directory
Task 4: Implemented development mode auth bypass in `middleware.ts:57-61` to prevent redirect loops
Task 5: Verified essential integrations preserved - Supabase client connections working, no console errors
Task 6: Disabled auth tests in `tests/components/auth/login.test.tsx:28` with `describe.skip()`

### Rollback Instructions
To restore original OAuth middleware functionality:

**Core Middleware Restoration:**
1. Restore `lib/supabase/middleware.ts:34-52` - uncomment manual auth cookie checking logic
2. Restore `lib/supabase/middleware.ts:75-83` - uncomment redirect logic for unauthenticated users
3. Remove development mode bypass from `middleware.ts:57-61`

**Component Restoration:**
4. Restore any removed OAuth callback routes in `/app/auth/` directory
5. Re-enable complex auth redirect logic in root middleware configuration
6. Restore server-side OAuth token exchange logic if removed

**Testing & Configuration:**
7. Restore auth tests by removing `.skip` from `tests/components/auth/login.test.tsx:28`
8. Re-enable any disabled auth-related middleware tests
9. Restore original Vercel middleware configuration for OAuth PKCE flow
