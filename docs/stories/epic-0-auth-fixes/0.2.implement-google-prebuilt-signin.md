## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on Story 0.1 which removed the complex OAuth middleware. With a clean authentication foundation, we can now implement Google's simplified pre-built signin approach using their One-Tap interface and direct ID token exchange.

### Architecture Integration Points

**Frontend Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]**
- Component location: `apps/web/app/components/auth/GoogleOneTapSignin.tsx`
- State management: Update existing AuthContext at `apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- Integration with landing page: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
- Script loading: Use Next.js Script component for Google GSI client

**Backend Architecture [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]**
- Supabase client integration: Use existing `lib/supabase/client.ts` patterns
- Authentication flow: Direct ID token exchange bypasses complex middleware
- Session management: Leverage Supabase Auth's built-in session handling
- No custom API routes needed - Google handles OAuth complexity

**Tech Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- React 19.1.0 with Next.js 15.5.0 for component implementation
- Supabase Auth 2.56.0 with signInWithIdToken for Google integration
- TypeScript 5.x for type safety with Google credential responses
- Next.js Script component for third-party script loading

**Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]**
- Google component: `apps/web/app/components/auth/GoogleOneTapSignin.tsx`
- Authentication context: `apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
- Environment config: `apps/web/.env.local` for Google Client ID
- Landing page integration: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`

**Integration Approach**
- Use Google's recommended One-Tap signin for optimal UX
- Implement nonce-based security following Google's best practices
- Integrate with existing Supabase user management without schema changes
- Preserve all existing user data and workspace associations

**Key Constraints**
- Must work with Chrome's FedCM for third-party cookie phase-out
- Google Client ID must be configured for both dev and production domains
- Maintain session compatibility with existing Supabase Auth patterns
- Preserve existing user workspace and conversation data

### Google One-Tap Implementation Details

**Required Google Configuration:**
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID for web application
- Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000`, `https://thinkhaven.co`
- Authorized redirect URIs: Not needed for ID token flow
- Consent screen configuration with privacy policy links

**Supabase Configuration:**
- Google provider enabled in Auth settings
- Google Client ID configured (secret not needed for ID token flow)
- User table will auto-populate from Google profile data
- Existing RLS policies will apply to Google-authenticated users

**Security Implementation:**
- Nonce generation using crypto.getRandomValues and SHA-256 hashing
- FedCM support via `use_fedcm_for_prompt: true`
- ID token validation handled by Supabase Auth
- Session management via secure HTTP-only cookies

### Testing

**Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]**
- Component tests: `tests/components/auth/GoogleOneTapSignin.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/google-auth-flow.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/google-signin.test.ts`
- Manual testing: Both development and production environments

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Test Google signin component initialization and rendering
- Verify credential response handling and Supabase integration
- Test session persistence across browser restarts
- Validate error handling for invalid or expired credentials
- Test signin flow in both Chrome and other browsers

**Test Scenarios**
- Successful Google signin with new user account creation
- Successful Google signin with existing user account
- Failed signin due to invalid credentials
- Network failure during signin process
- Session persistence after browser restart

### Technical Constraints

**Google API Requirements:**
- Google Client ID must be configured for production domain
- Consent screen must be published and verified by Google
- Privacy policy and terms of service links required
- FedCM compatibility for modern browser support

**Performance Requirements**
- Google One-Tap should appear within 2 seconds of page load
- Signin process should complete within 5 seconds
- No impact on existing page load performance
- Graceful fallback if Google services unavailable

**Browser Compatibility**
- Chrome with FedCM support (primary target)
- Safari and Firefox with traditional cookie-based flow
- Mobile browser compatibility for responsive signin
- Fallback signin options for unsupported browsers
