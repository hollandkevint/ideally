## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Requires Story 2.1 Completion**: Pathway Selection & Routing Interface must be implemented first
- Pathway selection mechanism established
- Enhanced PathwaySelector component available
- Database schema includes pathway analytics

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 (Conversational AI Coaching Interface):
- Claude Sonnet 4 streaming infrastructure established
- Context management and conversation persistence implemented
- AI prompting system with persona management available
- Session state management with real-time tracking

### Data Models
**BMad Sessions Schema Extensions** [Source: apps/web/supabase/migrations/001_bmad_method_schema.sql]
```sql
-- Extend existing schema for New Idea pathway
ALTER TABLE bmad_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS 
  pathway_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}', -- Store pathway-specific session data
  concept_document jsonb DEFAULT '{}'; -- Generated business concept

-- New table for New Idea pathway phases
CREATE TABLE bmad_new_idea_phases (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  session_id uuid references bmad_sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  phase_name text check (phase_name in ('ideation', 'market_exploration', 'concept_refinement', 'positioning')),
  completed boolean default false,
  insights jsonb default '{}',
  time_spent interval,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**New Idea Pathway Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface NewIdeaSession {
  rawIdea: string;
  ideationInsights: string[];
  marketOpportunities: MarketOpportunity[];
  uniqueValueProps: string[];
  competitiveLandscape: CompetitorAnalysis[];
  conceptDocument: BusinessConcept;
}
```

### API Specifications
**New Idea Pathway Endpoints** [Source: extending existing /api/bmad pattern]
- `POST /api/bmad` with `action: 'advance_new_idea_session'` - Handle New Idea pathway progression
- `POST /api/bmad` with `action: 'analyze_market_position'` - Market positioning analysis
- `POST /api/bmad` with `action: 'generate_concept_document'` - Create business concept document

**Claude Integration Requirements**:
```typescript
// New Idea pathway prompts
const NEW_IDEA_PROMPTS = {
  ideation: "You are Mary, a strategic business coach. Help expand this raw idea...",
  market_exploration: "Analyze market opportunities for this concept...", 
  positioning: "Develop unique value proposition and competitive positioning..."
};
```

### Component Specifications
