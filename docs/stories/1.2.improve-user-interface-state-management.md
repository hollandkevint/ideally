# Story 1.2: Improve User Interface State Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user switching between Mary Chat and BMad Method interfaces,
**I want** my initial input and session state to be preserved seamlessly,
**so that** I don't lose my strategic thinking context when navigating between different interaction modes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initial chat input is preserved when user switches from Mary Chat to BMad Method tab
2. BMad Method session recommendation buttons are fully functional and responsive to user clicks
3. Session confidence scoring displays meaningful percentages (above 30% threshold) with actionable recommendations
4. "New ideation session" button within BMad Method interface works correctly
5. Session state transitions are smooth without UI freezing or blank states
6. Users receive clear direction and guidance within active BMad sessions
7. Session continuation works properly when users return to existing sessions
8. All existing Mary Chat functionality remains intact and unaffected

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**From Story 1.1:** Database connectivity and session creation issues should be resolved, providing reliable backend foundation for UI state management improvements.

### Component Architecture and State Flow
[Source: Analysis of apps/web/app/workspace/[id]/page.tsx, apps/web/app/components/bmad/BmadInterface.tsx]

**Primary UI Components:**
- **WorkspacePage** (`apps/web/app/workspace/[id]/page.tsx`) - Main dual-pane interface with tab management
- **BmadInterface** (`apps/web/app/components/bmad/BmadInterface.tsx`) - BMad Method container with step management
- **PathwaySelector** - Handles pathway selection and session recommendations
- **ElicitationPanel** - Manages interactive session progression
- **SessionManager** - Active session controls and status display

**Current State Management Issues:**
- Chat input state (`messageInput`) exists only in WorkspacePage component
- No shared state mechanism between Mary Chat and BMad Method tabs
- Session state in `useBmadSession` hook lacks proper error handling
- Button event handlers may have binding or state update issues

### State Management Patterns
[Source: Analysis of React component structure]

**Current Implementation:**
- `useState` for local component state management
- `useCallback` for memoized event handlers
- Custom hook `useBmadSession` for BMad-specific state
- No global state management (Redux/Zustand) currently implemented

**Integration Points:**
- Workspace-level state: `activeTab`, `messageInput`, `workspace` object
- BMad-specific state: `currentSession`, `currentStep`, `mockElicitationData`
- Session persistence: Supabase database storage with local state sync

### User Experience Flow Issues Identified
[Source: User testing feedback from epic context]

**Specific Problems Documented:**
1. **Input Loss:** "Initial text blanked out, didn't pass over initial text that user put in"
2. **Low Confidence:** "Only 30% confidence interval, seems far too low for initial directions"
3. **Non-functional Buttons:** "New ideation session, nothing happened, button didn't work"
4. **Poor Guidance:** "Didn't give direction within a session, should analyze and give clear direction"

### File Locations and Integration Points

**Primary Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/app/workspace/[id]/page.tsx` - Main interface state management
- `apps/web/app/components/bmad/BmadInterface.tsx` - BMad container logic
- `apps/web/app/components/bmad/useBmadSession.ts` - Session state hook
- `apps/web/app/components/bmad/PathwaySelector.tsx` - Pathway selection and recommendations
- `apps/web/app/components/bmad/ElicitationPanel.tsx` - Interactive session guidance

**Supporting Files:**
- `apps/web/app/components/bmad/SessionManager.tsx` - Session controls
- `apps/web/app/components/dual-pane/StateBridge.tsx` - Cross-pane state sync
- Any shared state utilities (may need creation)

### Technical Constraints and Patterns
[Source: docs/current/production-state/CURRENT-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md]

**Technology Stack Constraints:**
- React 19.1.0 with modern hooks patterns
- Next.js 15.5.0 with client-side state management
- TypeScript strict mode requiring proper type definitions
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling patterns

**State Management Guidelines:**
- Maintain existing component hierarchy and props flow
- Use React hooks patterns consistent with current implementation
- Ensure state updates are immutable and properly tracked
- Add proper TypeScript types for all state interfaces

**Performance Considerations:**
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders during state transitions
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect and useCallback
- Implement proper cleanup for component unmounting
- Maintain <2s page load time requirements

### Error Handling and User Feedback
[Source: Current error patterns in UI components]

**Required Error Handling:**
- Session creation failures should show user-friendly messages
- Button click errors need proper user feedback
- State transition failures should have fallback states
- Network connectivity issues need graceful degradation

**User Feedback Requirements:**
- Loading states for all async operations
- Progress indicators for session operations
- Clear success/error messaging
- Contextual help and guidance tooltips

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: Project patterns and React best practices]

**Component Testing:**
- Unit tests for individual components with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies (useBmadSession hook, API calls)
- Test user interactions (button clicks, form submissions, tab switches)
- Verify state updates and prop changes

**Integration Testing:**
- Test complete user workflows from input to session completion
- Verify state persistence across component boundaries
- Test error scenarios and recovery paths
- Cross-browser state management testing

**Specific Test Scenarios:**
- Input preservation when switching tabs multiple times
- Button functionality under various session states
- Session continuation after page refresh
- Error handling when backend is unavailable
- Concurrent user interactions and state conflicts

**Testing Files Location:**
- Follow existing project testing patterns
- Component tests alongside component files or in `__tests__` directories
- Integration tests for complete user workflows
- Mock utilities for Supabase and session state

### Accessibility and UX Considerations

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Proper ARIA labels for dynamic state changes
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support for state transitions
- Focus management during interface switches

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Smooth animations for state transitions
- Consistent loading states and feedback
- Progressive disclosure of complex interface elements
- Mobile-responsive state management
