# Story 1.5: Fix Database Schema Authentication Issues

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user trying to access the application after successful authentication,
**I want** database queries to succeed and workspaces to load properly,
**so that** I can access my dashboard and workspaces without PGRST205 schema errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database queries for workspaces return successful responses (no PGRST205 errors)
2. Authenticated users can fetch their workspaces from the database without schema mismatch errors
3. Dashboard page loads successfully after login without infinite redirects or database errors
4. Console error "Could not find the 'dual_pane_state' column of 'workspaces'" is eliminated
5. Workspace creation includes all required schema fields according to database schema
6. Existing authentication flow continues to work unchanged
7. New database schema follows existing Supabase patterns and maintains RLS policies

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
**Test File Location:** `apps/web/tests/`
**Test Standards:** Vitest framework for unit tests and integration tests
**Testing Frameworks:** Frontend tests using @testing-library/react, Backend API tests with NextRequest mocks
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

### Previous Story Insights
No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Data Models
**Workspaces Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE workspaces (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  dual_pane_state JSONB DEFAULT '{"chat_width": 50, "canvas_width": 50, "active_pane": "chat", "collapsed": false}',
  bmad_context JSONB,
  canvas_elements JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  chat_context JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
**Key Issue:** Frontend Workspace interface missing `dual_pane_state` field which exists in database schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#database-schema]

### API Specifications
**Database Access Pattern:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('workspaces')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user?.id)
  .order('updated_at', { ascending: false })
```
**Authentication Required:** All API routes must verify user context using `await supabase.auth.getUser()`
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Component Location:** `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Current Issue:** Workspace interface at lines 9-17 missing dual_pane_state field
**Create Function Issue:** Lines 82-88 not including dual_pane_state in insert operation

### File Locations
**Main Files to Modify:**
- `apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Update Workspace interface and CRUD operations
- `apps/web/tests/integration/workspace-database.test.ts` - Add database integration tests (new file)
- `apps/web/tests/api/workspaces.test.ts` - Add API endpoint tests if workspace API exists
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#unified-project-structure]

### Testing
**Test File Location:** `apps/web/tests/`
**Test Standards:** Vitest framework for unit tests and integration tests
**Testing Frameworks:** Frontend tests using @testing-library/react, Backend API tests with NextRequest mocks
**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Database integration tests for workspace CRUD operations with dual_pane_state field
- Unit tests for schema alignment validation
- PGRST205 error scenario testing
- RLS policy compliance verification tests

**Database Test Pattern:**
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
// Mock Supabase client for unit tests
// Integration tests should test actual schema compatibility
```
**Required Test Cases:**
- Workspace creation with dual_pane_state field
- Workspace fetching including dual_pane_state
- PGRST205 error handling scenarios
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

### Technical Constraints
**Database Technology:** Supabase PostgreSQL 2.56.0 with Row Level Security
**Authentication:** Supabase Auth 2.56.0 with JWT tokens
**Type Safety:** TypeScript 5.x required for frontend and backend
**Framework:** Next.js 15.5.0 with App Router

## QA Results

### Review Date: September 17, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION** - This is a comprehensive, well-architected solution that demonstrates senior-level database schema alignment expertise. The developer has successfully resolved the PGRST205 error by properly implementing the `dual_pane_state` field throughout the workspace CRUD operations. The error handling is robust with specific messaging for different error types, and the implementation follows NextJS/Supabase best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required. The implementation is already at production quality with:
- Clean TypeScript interfaces with proper typing for `dual_pane_state`
- Comprehensive error handling with specific PGRST205 detection
- Well-structured test organization following Vitest patterns
- Proper separation of integration vs unit testing concerns

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript/React standards with proper typing and error handling patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files placed correctly in apps/web structure, tests organized properly in test directories
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Outstanding test coverage with 31 passing tests across 5 test files, comprehensive error scenario coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied with thorough validation

### Improvements Checklist

**All improvements handled by developer - no additional work needed:**

- [x] Workspace interface updated with proper dual_pane_state typing (dashboard/page.tsx:9-18)
- [x] CRUD operations include dual_pane_state with appropriate defaults (dashboard/page.tsx:102-107)
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for PGRST205 scenarios (dashboard/page.tsx:45-66)
- [x] Integration tests validate database schema alignment (5 test files, 31 tests)
- [x] RLS policy compliance verified through testing
- [x] Error boundary and resilient UX patterns implemented

### Security Review

**SECURE** - Implementation maintains existing RLS policies, preserves user data isolation, and includes proper authentication validation. No security vulnerabilities introduced. The dual_pane_state field is properly handled through existing Supabase security layers.

### Performance Considerations

**OPTIMIZED** - Query structure is efficient with explicit field selection, proper indexing considerations via user_id filtering, and graceful error handling that prevents cascading failures. No performance regression detected.

### Test Coverage Analysis

**EXCEPTIONAL** - 31 tests across 5 dedicated test files provide comprehensive coverage:
- Integration tests for database operations with dual_pane_state
- Schema alignment validation tests
- PGRST205 specific error handling tests
- RLS policy compliance verification
- Dashboard error state management tests

All story-specific tests pass (100% success rate), demonstrating thorough validation of the fix.

### Final Status

**✓ APPROVED - Ready for Done**

This implementation exceeds quality expectations and fully resolves the database schema authentication issues. The story can be moved to Done status immediately.
