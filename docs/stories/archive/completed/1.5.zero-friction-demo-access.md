## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Based on recent database authentication fixes, the login redirect loop issues have been resolved at the database level, but user access is still blocked by authentication requirements. This story creates an authentication bypass for demo purposes while maintaining security for protected features.

### Architecture Integration Points

**Frontend Architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]**
- Follow existing component organization patterns under `apps/web/app/components/`
- Create new demo-specific components in `components/demo/` directory
- Use established component template with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Integrate with existing Zustand state management for demo progress tracking

**Tech Stack Integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- Use Next.js 15.5.0 App Router for `/demo` routes with SSG optimization
- Implement with TypeScript 5.x for full type safety
- Style with Tailwind CSS 4.0 following existing design system
- Ensure compatibility with React 19.1.0 concurrent features
- Optimize with Turbopack for fast development builds

**Data Models [Source: apps/web/scripts/seed-demo-data.js]**
- Utilize existing `demoScenarios` array containing 3 strategic conversations
- Scenario structure: `{ name, description, chat_context[] }`
- Message format: `{ id, role, content, timestamp, metadata?: { strategic_tags } }`
- No database queries required - static data integration only

**Component Specifications**
- **DemoHub Component**: Grid layout with scenario cards, progress indicators
- **DemoScenarioCard**: Preview with title, description, message count, duration
- **DemoConversationDisplay**: Read-only chat interface matching existing message styling  
- **StrategicInsightsPanel**: Real-time methodology highlighting with BMad Method indicators
- **ConversionOverlay**: Modal component with staged conversion messaging

**File Locations [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]**
- Demo routes: `apps/web/app/demo/page.tsx`, `apps/web/app/demo/[scenario]/page.tsx`
- Demo components: `apps/web/app/components/demo/DemoHub.tsx`, etc.
- Shared types: `apps/web/types/demo.ts` for demo-specific interfaces
- Demo utilities: `apps/web/lib/demo/demoData.ts` for scenario loading logic

**API Integration**
- No API endpoints required - purely static demo data
- No authentication or database queries needed for demo functionality
- Conversion tracking can integrate with existing analytics patterns

**Styling Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**
- Component naming: PascalCase (e.g., `DemoScenarioGrid`)
- Hook naming: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useDemoProgress`)
- CSS classes: Tailwind utility classes following existing patterns
- File structure: Follow established component organization

**Performance Considerations**
- Static demo data eliminates database query overhead
- SSG pre-rendering for `/demo` routes reduces load times
- Lazy loading for conversion overlays to optimize initial page load
- Image optimization for scenario preview thumbnails

**Security Notes**
- Demo routes are intentionally public and require no authentication
- No sensitive data exposure in demo scenarios (pre-sanitized content)
- Conversion tracking should not store PII without user consent

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]**
- Unit tests: `apps/web/__tests__/demo/` directory
- E2E tests: `apps/web/playwright/demo.spec.ts`
- Component tests: Co-located with components in `__tests__` subdirectories

**Testing Frameworks**
- Unit Testing: Vitest 3.2.4 for fast component and utility testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright for complete user journey validation
- Test patterns: Follow existing testing architecture patterns

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Test demo data loading and display accuracy
- Validate responsive design on multiple viewport sizes
- Test conversion flow completion and tracking
- Verify demo navigation and progress tracking
- Test browser compatibility for demo scenarios

**Testing Strategy**
- Mock demo data in unit tests using existing scenarios
- Test conversion overlay timing and trigger conditions  
- Validate mobile touch interactions and responsive layout
- Test performance with large demo conversation data
