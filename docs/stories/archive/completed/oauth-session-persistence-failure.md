# Story: OAuth Session Persistence Failure - Dashboard Redirect Loop

## Status
**DONE** - OAuth Session Persistence Issue Resolved & Deployed

## Story
**As a** user who successfully completes OAuth authentication,
**I want** my session to persist properly on the client side,
**so that** I can access the dashboard without being redirected back to login.

## Problem Summary
OAuth callbacks are succeeding on the server side, but sessions are not persisting to the client, causing authenticated users to be redirected back to login when attempting to access the dashboard.

### Error Pattern Observed
```
OAuth Authentication Wait: Cycle 1/5
OAuth Authentication Wait: Cycle 2/5
OAuth Authentication Wait: Cycle 3/5
OAuth Authentication Wait: Cycle 4/5
OAuth Authentication Wait: Cycle 5/5
No authenticated user found after wait
Redirecting to login...
```

## Acceptance Criteria
1. OAuth callback success must result in client-side session availability within 5-10 seconds
2. Dashboard access should not require repeated login attempts after successful OAuth completion
3. Session persistence must work consistently across production and development environments
4. User authentication state should be immediately available to client-side components after OAuth callback
5. Cookie synchronization between server-side OAuth handling and client-side session management must function correctly
6. Authentication wait cycles should successfully detect session availability within the 5-cycle limit
7. Session data must persist across page refreshes and browser navigation
8. Error logging must provide clear visibility into session creation vs. session availability timing issues

## Technical Analysis

### Current Implementation Context
**OAuth Flow Components:**
- OAuth Provider: Google (configured in Supabase)
- Authentication Library: Supabase Auth 2.56.0
- OAuth Flow: Authorization Code with PKCE
- Callback Route: `/auth/callback/route.ts`
- Session Storage: Supabase cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax)
- Client Auth Context: `/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx`

### Session Persistence Chain
```
1. OAuth Callback Success (Server) → 2. Session Creation (Supabase) → 3. Cookie Setting → 4. Client Session Availability
```

### Suspected Root Causes
1. **Cookie Synchronization Delay**: Server-side session creation not immediately reflected in client-side cookies
2. **Authentication Context Timing**: Client-side auth context not polling/refreshing session state after OAuth callback
3. **Supabase Session Refresh**: Potential delay in Supabase client-side session initialization
4. **Environment Configuration**: Production vs. development cookie/domain configuration differences
5. **Race Condition**: Dashboard page loading before session synchronization completes

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Server-Side Session Creation Verification
1. **OAuth Callback Logging Enhancement**
   - Add detailed timing logs to `/auth/callback/route.ts`
   - Track session creation success/failure rates
   - Monitor cookie setting behavior

2. **Supabase Session API Analysis**
   - Verify `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()` implementation
   - Confirm proper error handling for session creation failures
   - Validate session data completeness after OAuth exchange

### Phase 2: Client-Side Session Availability Investigation
1. **AuthContext Behavior Analysis**
   - Review `useAuth()` hook session polling logic
   - Investigate session refresh triggers and timing
   - Analyze authentication state change event handling

2. **Session Synchronization Testing**
   - Test timing between OAuth callback completion and client session availability
   - Identify optimal wait strategies for session synchronization
   - Investigate browser-specific session persistence behaviors

### Phase 3: Environment & Configuration Audit
1. **Production vs. Development Comparison**
   - Compare Supabase configuration between environments
   - Audit cookie settings and domain configurations
   - Validate OAuth redirect URLs and callback handling

2. **Cookie Behavior Analysis**
   - Test cookie setting and retrieval timing
   - Investigate cross-domain cookie issues
   - Validate secure cookie behavior in production

## Dev Notes

### Authentication Flow Context
**Current OAuth Implementation:**
- OAuth initiation: Google OAuth button in `/login/page.tsx`
- Callback handling: `/auth/callback/route.ts` with PKCE verification
- Session management: Supabase Auth with cookie-based persistence
- Client context: AuthContext provides `useAuth()` hook with user state

**Key Files for Investigation:**
- `/apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Server-side OAuth callback handler
- `/apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Client-side authentication context
- `/apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard authentication gating
- `/apps/web/app/login/page.tsx` - OAuth initiation point

### Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side)
```

### Session Flow Timing Analysis
```
Expected Flow:
OAuth Initiation → Google Auth → Callback (200ms) → Session Creation (500ms) → Client Session (1000ms) → Dashboard Access

Current Behavior:
OAuth Initiation → Google Auth → Callback (200ms) → Session Creation (500ms) → [SESSION SYNC FAILURE] → Redirect Loop
```

### Diagnostic Questions
1. Is the OAuth callback successfully creating a server-side session?
2. Are cookies being properly set with correct domain/security attributes?
3. Is the client-side AuthContext polling for session updates after OAuth?
4. Are there timing issues between callback completion and client session availability?
5. Do production environment settings differ from development in ways that affect session persistence?

## Success Criteria
- [x] OAuth callback success results in client session availability within 10 seconds
- [x] Dashboard access success rate >95% after OAuth completion
- [x] Session persistence across page refreshes and browser navigation
- [x] Elimination of authentication wait cycle failures
- [x] Clear error logging for any remaining session synchronization issues
- [x] Consistent behavior across production and development environments
- [x] Zero infinite redirect loops after successful OAuth authentication

## Testing
- Manual OAuth flow testing across multiple browsers
- Automated session persistence testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Production environment session success rate monitoring
- Session timing analysis under various network conditions
- Cross-browser compatibility validation for session handling
