### Data Models
**BMad Sessions Schema Extensions** [Source: apps/web/supabase/migrations/001_bmad_method_schema.sql]
```sql
-- Extend existing schema for New Idea pathway
ALTER TABLE bmad_sessions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS 
  pathway_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}', -- Store pathway-specific session data
  concept_document jsonb DEFAULT '{}'; -- Generated business concept

-- New table for New Idea pathway phases
CREATE TABLE bmad_new_idea_phases (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  session_id uuid references bmad_sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  phase_name text check (phase_name in ('ideation', 'market_exploration', 'concept_refinement', 'positioning')),
  completed boolean default false,
  insights jsonb default '{}',
  time_spent interval,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**New Idea Pathway Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface NewIdeaSession {
  rawIdea: string;
  ideationInsights: string[];
  marketOpportunities: MarketOpportunity[];

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDINGS: Implementation is significantly incomplete despite claims of completion.**

**What Was Actually Implemented (✓ HIGH QUALITY):**
- Core pathway logic in `new-idea-pathway.ts` - Excellent architecture with proper time management, phase transitions, and validation
- Comprehensive templates in `new-idea-templates.ts` - Well-structured with detailed AI prompts and elicitation sequences
- Market analysis engine in `market-analysis.ts` - Robust with proper interfaces and mock data structure
- Database migration `002_new_idea_pathway_schema.sql` - Proper RLS policies and performance indexes
- Concept document React component `ConceptDocument.tsx` - Clean, type-safe implementation

**What's Missing (✗ CRITICAL GAPS):**
- **React Components**: `NewIdeaPathway.tsx`, `IdeationPhase.tsx`, `MarketExploration.tsx` - NOT FOUND
- **API Integration**: `/api/bmad/route.ts` - NO API ENDPOINTS EXIST
- **Component Integration**: Claims of BmadInterface.tsx and SessionManager.tsx updates - NOT VERIFIED
- **Complete User Journey**: No working pathway from user input to concept generation

**Technical Debt:**
- Mock implementations in market analysis instead of Claude API integration
- Test files use extensive mocking rather than integration testing
- Missing actual user interface components for the pathway

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - Cannot improve incomplete implementation. Core issues require development completion rather than code improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS - Existing code follows TypeScript conventions and naming standards
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS - File organization aligns with established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ FAIL - Tests exist but test non-existent components and APIs
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ FAIL - Major acceptance criteria not implemented (see below)

### Acceptance Criteria Analysis

**AC1 - Creative Expansion Framework**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE**
- Templates exist but no UI components to execute framework
- Phase progression logic works but no user interface

**AC2 - Market Positioning Guidance**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE**
- Analysis engine exists with mock data only
- No AI integration, no API endpoints to serve analysis

**AC3 - Concept Development Flow**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE**
- 30-minute session logic exists but no executable pathway
- Time allocation works but no user interface to interact with

**AC4 - Idea Documentation**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
- ConceptDocument component exists and is well-built
- Missing integration with session data and generation workflow

**AC5 - Progress Tracking**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE**
- Progress calculation logic exists but no visual components
- No session management UI components found

### Security Review

**Database Security**: ✓ EXCELLENT - RLS policies properly implemented with user isolation
**Data Handling**: ✓ GOOD - JSONB fields with proper structure for sensitive business ideas
**API Security**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED - No API endpoints exist to review

### Performance Considerations

**Core Logic Performance**: ✓ EXCELLENT - Efficient algorithms for time tracking and phase management
**Database Optimization**: ✓ GOOD - Proper indexes for session queries
**User Experience**: ❌ CANNOT ASSESS - No functional user interface exists

### Critical Implementation Gaps

1. **No Functional User Interface** - Story claims pathway components that don't exist
2. **No API Integration** - Business logic exists but no way to execute sessions
3. **Test-Reality Mismatch** - E2E tests reference UI elements that don't exist
4. **Incomplete Value Chain** - Cannot demonstrate end-to-end user value

### Required Actions Before Approval

**BLOCKING ISSUES - Must Fix:**
- [ ] Create missing React components: `NewIdeaPathway.tsx`, `IdeationPhase.tsx`, `MarketExploration.tsx`
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for session management and market analysis
- [ ] Connect UI components to business logic and database
- [ ] Replace mock market analysis with actual Claude integration
- [ ] Update integration tests to test real implementation, not mocks

**IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- [ ] Add error boundaries for pathway component failures
- [ ] Implement progress persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for 30-minute session constraint
- [ ] Create component storybook for pathway UI elements

### Final Status

**❌ CHANGES REQUIRED - Implementation Incomplete**

**Root Cause**: Developer completed excellent backend logic and data models but failed to implement the user-facing components that deliver the actual user value. The story cannot be considered complete without a functional pathway interface.

**Recommendation**: Return to development for UI component completion. The foundation is solid - this is implementation completion, not architectural rework.
