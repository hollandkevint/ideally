## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 (Conversational AI Coaching Interface):
- Comprehensive AI infrastructure established with Claude Sonnet 4 integration
- Streaming conversation system with <100ms latency achieved
- Context management and session persistence fully implemented
- Database schema includes conversations, messages, and context tables
- Error handling and authentication patterns established

### Data Models
**BMad Sessions Schema** [Source: apps/web/supabase/migrations/001_bmad_method_schema.sql]
```sql
bmad_sessions (
  pathway text check (pathway in ('new-idea', 'business-model', 'strategic-optimization')),
  current_phase text not null,
  current_template text not null,
  templates text[] not null default '{}'
)
```

**New Pathway Types Required**:

- Pathway recommendation endpoint with user input analysis
- Session creation with pathway-specific template selection

### Component Specifications
**Existing Components** [Source: apps/web/app/components/bmad/README.md]
