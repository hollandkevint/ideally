# Story TD.2: Authentication Monitoring Implementation

## Status
**DONE** - Authentication Monitoring Infrastructure Complete

## Story
**As a** Site Reliability Engineer/DevOps Engineer,
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of authentication success rates and failure patterns,
**so that** we can proactively detect and respond to authentication issues before they impact users at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Authentication events are logged with sufficient detail for analysis
2. Success rate metrics are tracked for both email and OAuth authentication methods
3. Failed authentication attempts are categorized by error type (PKCE, invalid credentials, network, etc.)
4. Real-time alerts are configured for authentication success rate drops below threshold
5. Dashboard displays authentication metrics with historical trends
6. Authentication latency is tracked (time from initiation to successful login)
7. Geographic and device-type breakdowns are available for authentication patterns
8. Monitoring data is retained for at least 30 days

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement authentication event logging (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Add structured logging to OAuth callback route

  - [x] Configure Vercel Analytics custom events for auth tracking
  - [x] Create authentication monitoring dashboard
  - [x] Set up custom metrics in monitoring platform
  - [x] Configure data retention policies

- [x] Implement alerting system (AC: 4)
  - [x] Define success rate thresholds (e.g., < 95% triggers alert)
  - [x] Configure alert channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
  - [x] Set up graduated alerting (warning at 95%, critical at 90%)
  - [x] Create runbooks for common authentication issues

- [x] Add detailed analytics (AC: 7)
  - [x] Track authentication by geographic region
  - [x] Track authentication by device type/browser
  - [x] Identify patterns in failed authentications
  - [x] Create cohort analysis for authentication methods

- [x] Documentation and operational procedures (AC: 8)
  - [x] Document monitoring setup and configuration
  - [x] Create operational runbooks for authentication issues
  - [x] Define SLIs/SLOs for authentication service
  - [x] Document data retention and privacy considerations

## Dev Notes

### Monitoring Infrastructure
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#L27-28]

**Monitoring Platform:**
- Primary: Vercel Analytics (Built-in monitoring and logging)
- Logging: Vercel Logs (Serverless function logs)
- Custom Events: Can be sent to Vercel Analytics for tracking

**Current Authentication Implementation:**
- OAuth Provider: Google via Supabase Auth
- Authentication Methods: Email/Password, Google OAuth
- Session Management: Supabase JWT tokens with cookie storage

### Technical Context

**Key Files to Instrument:**
- `/apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback (already has some logging)
- `/apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Client-side auth state management
- `/apps/web/app/login/page.tsx` - Login initiation point
- `/apps/web/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` - Auth middleware for protected routes

**Existing Logging:**
The codebase already includes console logging for authentication events:
```typescript
console.log('OAuth authentication successful:', {
  userId: data.user.id,
  email: data.user.email,
  provider: data.user.app_metadata?.provider,
  sessionId: data.session.access_token.substring(0, 10) + '...'
})
```

**Metrics to Track:**
1. Authentication Success Rate = (Successful Logins / Total Login Attempts) Ã— 100
2. Authentication Latency = Time from login initiation to dashboard load
3. Error Distribution = Count by error type (PKCE, network, invalid credentials, etc.)
4. Authentication Method Distribution = OAuth vs Email/Password usage
5. Session Duration = Time from login to logout/expiry

**Alert Thresholds (Suggested):**
- Success Rate < 95%: Warning
- Success Rate < 90%: Critical
- Latency > 5s (p95): Warning
- Latency > 10s (p95): Critical
- Error Rate > 5% for specific error type: Investigation needed

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Do NOT log passwords or sensitive tokens
- Hash/anonymize user identifiers in logs
- Comply with GDPR/CCPA for data retention
- Ensure PII is not exposed in monitoring dashboards

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Basic Logging**
- Structured logging with consistent format
- Use log levels appropriately (info for success, error for failures)
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing

**Phase 2: Metrics Collection**
- Send custom events to Vercel Analytics
- Calculate derived metrics (success rates, latencies)
- Store aggregated metrics for trending

**Phase 3: Visualization & Alerting**
- Create monitoring dashboard
- Configure alert rules
- Set up notification channels

## Testing
- Unit tests for metrics calculation logic
- Integration tests for event logging
- Verify alerts trigger at correct thresholds
- Test data retention and cleanup
- Validate privacy compliance (no PII in logs)
