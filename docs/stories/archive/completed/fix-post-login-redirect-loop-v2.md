# Story 1.5: Fix Post-Login Redirect Loop

## Status
**DONE** - Post-Login Redirect Loop Fixed

## Story
**As a** user who has successfully logged in,
**I want** to be redirected to my dashboard without infinite loops,
**so that** I can access my workspaces and start using the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Successful login redirects to `/dashboard` without infinite loops or ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS browser errors
2. Dashboard page loads successfully with user's workspaces even when database queries fail
3. Error states are handled gracefully with user-friendly feedback and retry mechanisms
4. Existing authentication flow continues to work unchanged without regression
5. Workspace loading follows existing patterns and maintains current user experience
6. Error handling provides clear feedback to users with actionable recovery options
7. Redirect logic is covered by appropriate tests and follows established patterns
8. Error boundaries handle database connection failures gracefully without crashing the application
9. No regression in existing authentication flow verified through testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 0.4 (Authentication Testing & Validation): The Google One-Tap authentication is working correctly with >95% success rate. The issue is not with authentication itself but with the post-authentication redirect handling.

From Story 1.1 (Fix Session Creation Database Failures): Database error handling patterns have been established for PGRST205 errors with proper error messaging and retry mechanisms.

### Data Models
**Workspace Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#workspace]:
```typescript
interface Workspace {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  dual_pane_state: DualPaneState;
  bmad_context?: BMadContext;
  canvas_elements: CanvasElement[];
  chat_context: ChatMessage[];
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**Authentication Context** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]:
```typescript
const { user, loading } = useAuth()
```

### API Specifications
**Authentication Flow** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#auth-flow]:
- Frontend checks authentication state via `useAuth()` hook
- Supabase handles session management and token validation
- Protected routes verify user context before rendering
- Database queries use Row Level Security (RLS) for user data isolation

### Component Specifications
**Landing Page Component** [Source: apps/web/app/page.tsx]:
- Currently has redirect logic disabled on lines 32-41 to prevent infinite loops
- Uses `useAuth()` hook for authentication state management
- Implements conditional rendering based on authentication status

**Dashboard Page Component** [Source: apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx]:
- Implements comprehensive error handling for PGRST205 database errors (lines 44-50)
- Uses callback pattern for workspace fetching with proper error states
- Includes retry mechanism for failed database operations

### File Locations
**Primary Files to Modify** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- `/apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Landing page with redirect logic
- `/apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard with workspace loading
- `/apps/web/lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication state management
- `/apps/web/app/components/ui/` - Error boundary and error state components

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- `/apps/web/tests/components/` - Component unit tests
- `/apps/web/tests/integration/` - Authentication flow tests
- `/apps/web/tests/e2e/` - End-to-end redirect flow tests

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing for redirect logic and error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Complete authentication flow including database interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full user journey from login to dashboard access

**Test Patterns** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]:
```typescript
// Authentication flow test pattern
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
import { useAuth } from '@/lib/auth/AuthContext'

describe('Authentication Redirect Flow', () => {
  it('redirects authenticated user to dashboard', async () => {
    // Test implementation following established patterns
  })
})
```

### Technical Constraints
**Error Handling Patterns** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All API routes must use standard error format and logging
- Error boundaries required for database connection failures
- User-friendly error messages with actionable recovery options

**Authentication Requirements** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
- Always verify user context before processing requests
- Use Supabase session management for state persistence
- Implement proper middleware for protected routes

**State Management** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- Authentication state managed through AuthContext
- Loading states must prevent premature redirects

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `/apps/web/tests/` following established directory structure
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing
- Test coverage requirements: >90% for authentication-related code
- Integration tests required for cross-system authentication flows

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for redirect logic components
- Integration tests for authentication flow with database interactions
- E2E tests for complete login-to-dashboard user journey
- Error scenario testing for database failures and network issues
- Regression testing to ensure existing authentication functionality remains intact
