# Fix Post-Login Redirect Loop - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user who has successfully logged in**,
I want **to be redirected to my dashboard without infinite loops**,
So that **I can access my workspaces and start using the application**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Authentication flow, dashboard routing, and workspace loading
- Technology: Next.js 15 App Router, Supabase Auth, React useEffect hooks
- Follows pattern: Existing auth redirect logic in app/page.tsx and dashboard/page.tsx
- Touch points: Landing page auth check, dashboard page mounting, workspace fetching

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Successful login redirects to `/dashboard` without infinite loops
2. Dashboard page loads successfully with user's workspaces
3. Error states are handled gracefully with user feedback

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing authentication flow continues to work unchanged
5. Workspace loading follows existing patterns in dashboard/page.tsx
6. Error handling maintains current user experience patterns

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Redirect logic is covered by appropriate tests
8. Error boundaries handle database connection failures gracefully
9. No regression in existing authentication flow verified

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Fix infinite redirect loop caused by landing page auth logic in app/page.tsx
- Add proper error handling for failed workspace queries in dashboard/page.tsx
- Implement fallback UI when database queries fail

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Use existing auth context from lib/auth/AuthContext
- Follow error handling patterns in workspace/[id]/page.tsx
- Maintain existing loading states and user feedback

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not break existing authentication flow
- Error handling should be user-friendly
- Redirect logic should be predictable and stable

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Landing page redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`
- Dashboard fails to load due to database errors (PGRST205)
- Failed dashboard mount triggers redirect back to landing page
- Creates infinite loop: `/` → `/dashboard` → `/` → `/dashboard`

**Console Error Sequence:**
1. `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` - Browser stops redirect loop
2. `PGRST205` - Database schema errors preventing workspace loading
3. `RSC Payload Failures` - Next.js server component hydration issues

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Break the Redirect Loop**
- Add loading state management to prevent premature redirects
- Implement proper error boundaries in dashboard page
- Add timeout/retry logic for database queries

**Phase 2: Graceful Error Handling**
- Show user-friendly error messages when database fails
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Implement offline/connection state indicators

**Phase 3: Fallback UI**
- Create empty state for failed workspace loading
- Allow users to create new workspaces if existing ones fail to load
- Maintain functionality even with partial database failures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Login redirects to dashboard without infinite loops
- [ ] Dashboard loads successfully or shows appropriate error state
- [ ] Database connection failures don't crash the application
- [ ] Users can recover from error states without manual URL navigation
- [ ] `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` error is eliminated
- [ ] Existing authentication functionality works unchanged
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing authentication redirect logic
- **Mitigation:** Add fallback handling without changing core auth flow
- **Rollback:** Remove error boundaries and revert to original redirect logic

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes not required (handling failures gracefully)
- [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible

## Error Scenarios to Handle

1. **Database Connection Failure:** Show offline indicator, retry button
2. **RLS Policy Failure:** Show access denied message, logout option
3. **Workspace Loading Timeout:** Show loading spinner, then error state
4. **Partial Workspace Load:** Show available workspaces, note failures

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified
- [x] Success criteria are testable
- [x] Rollback approach is simple

**Dependencies:**
- Should be implemented after "Fix Database Schema Authentication Issues" story
- Can be partially implemented independently with error handling

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Blocking User Access)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Dependencies:** Ideally after database schema fixes
**Risk Level:** Medium (touching core auth flow)
