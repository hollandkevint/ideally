# Story 2.1: Choose-Your-Adventure Session Launcher

**Epic:** Choose-Your-Adventure Adaptive Coaching Engine  
**Priority:** High (MVP Critical)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Sprint:** BMad Method MVP

## User Story

**As an entrepreneur/consultant with a specific strategic challenge,**  
**I want to select the type of strategic thinking session that matches my current need,**  
**So that I receive tailored BMad Method coaching from the very beginning.**

## Acceptance Criteria

### ðŸŽ¯ **Core MVP Requirements**

1. **Session Pathway Selection**
   - [ ] Session launcher presents 3 primary BMad pathways with visual previews:
     - **"I have a brand new idea"** â†’ Creative expansion and market positioning using BMad brainstorming
     - **"I'm stuck on a business model problem"** â†’ Revenue streams and value proposition analysis
     - **"I need to refine a feature/concept"** â†’ User needs validation and competitive positioning
   - [ ] Each pathway shows expected outcomes, time commitment (30 minutes), and Mary's coaching approach
   - [ ] One-click pathway selection with clear value proposition for each option

2. **BMad Method Integration**
   - [ ] Pathway selection triggers specific BMad templates:
     - New Idea â†’ `brainstorm-session-tmpl.yaml` + `project-brief-tmpl.yaml`
     - Business Model â†’ `business-model-canvas-tmpl.yaml` + `market-research-tmpl.yaml`
     - Feature Refinement â†’ `competitor-analysis-tmpl.yaml` + `user-story-tmpl.yaml`
   - [ ] Mary's persona adapts based on pathway selection
   - [ ] BMad Method workspace context established from session launch

3. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Secondary options for hybrid approaches: "My idea needs both validation AND business model work"
   - [ ] Session type influences initial Mary prompts and suggested visual tools
   - [ ] One-click session restart with different pathway if user realizes they chose incorrectly
   - [ ] Session type metadata captured for Mary's context and analytics

### ðŸ”„ **Advanced Features (Post-MVP)**
- Interactive pathway quiz for uncertain users
- Custom pathway creation for repeat users
- Integration with workspace history for continuation sessions

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 3 BMad Method pathways functional with distinct coaching approaches
- [ ] Mary persona adapts appropriately for each pathway selection
- [ ] Session launcher integrates with existing dual-pane workspace
- [ ] User can successfully complete end-to-end session for each pathway
- [ ] Analytics capture pathway selection for optimization
- [ ] Unit tests for pathway logic and template selection
- [ ] Documentation for BMad Method pathway configuration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Frontend Components
```typescript
// Core launcher component
<SessionLauncher 
  onPathwaySelect={(pathway) => initiateBmadSession(pathway)}
  availablePathways={bmadPathways}
/>

// Pathway selection drives BMad template loading
interface BmadPathway {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  templates: string[];
  expectedOutcome: string;
  timeCommitment: number;
  maryPersona: 'analyst' | 'strategist' | 'coach';
}
```

### Backend Integration
- Load appropriate BMad YAML templates based on pathway
- Initialize Mary's system prompt with pathway-specific context
- Track pathway analytics for optimization

## BMad Method Alignment

This story implements **BMad Method Core Principle**: "Begin with clear intention" by having users explicitly choose their strategic thinking approach rather than entering generic conversations.

**Knowledge Base Integration:**
- References `bmad-kb.md` for pathway definitions
- Uses `brainstorming-techniques.md` for technique selection
- Leverages existing BMad templates for structured workflows

## User Testing Scenarios

1. **New Entrepreneur:** "I have this app idea but don't know if it's viable"
   - Expected Path: "I have a brand new idea" â†’ BMad brainstorming session
   - Success: User completes idea exploration with structured market validation

2. **Struggling SaaS Founder:** "I can't figure out how to monetize my product"
   - Expected Path: "I'm stuck on a business model problem" â†’ Revenue model analysis
   - Success: User identifies 2-3 specific monetization approaches

3. **Product Manager:** "This feature isn't resonating with users"
   - Expected Path: "I need to refine a feature/concept" â†’ User validation framework
   - Success: User has clear next steps for feature iteration
