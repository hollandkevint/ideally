  rationale: |
    Story 0.4 demonstrates excellent functional implementation with 100% authentication
    test success rate and performance that exceeds requirements. The authentication
    foundation is solid and ready to support Epic 1 development. However, critical
    security vulnerabilities, particularly weak nonce generation, must be addressed
    before production deployment. The implementation quality is good with comprehensive
    error handling and proper architectural patterns. Immediate security fixes are
    mandatory, but Epic 1 can proceed with the understanding that security hardening
    will be completed in parallel.
