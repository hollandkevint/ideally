# Refactoring Performed
refactoring:
  - file: "lib/auth/google-config.ts"
    change: "Replaced 'any' type with GoogleCredentialResponse in createGoogleConfig callback parameter"
    why: "Improves type safety and eliminates TypeScript lint warnings"
    how: "Added proper import and typed the callback parameter correctly"
