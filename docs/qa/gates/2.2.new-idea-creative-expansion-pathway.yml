# Quality Gate Decision
# Story 2.2: "New Idea" Creative Expansion Pathway

gate_id: "2.2.new-idea-creative-expansion-pathway"
story_version: "1.1"
review_date: "2025-01-16"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)"

# FAIL - Implementation incomplete despite claims
decision: "FAIL"

confidence: "HIGH"
severity: "CRITICAL"

# Summary of findings
summary: |
  Implementation is significantly incomplete despite developer claims of completion.
  Excellent backend logic and data models exist, but critical user-facing components
  are missing, making the pathway non-functional for end users.

# Risk Assessment
risk_assessment:
  probability: "HIGH"
  impact: "HIGH"
  risk_level: "CRITICAL"

  risks:
    - "Users cannot actually use the New Idea pathway - no functional UI"
    - "Story marked complete when major deliverables missing"
    - "E2E tests reference non-existent UI elements"
    - "Mock implementations instead of real Claude integration"
    - "Cannot demonstrate business value to stakeholders"

# Acceptance Criteria Analysis
acceptance_criteria:
  ac1_creative_expansion:
    status: "INCOMPLETE"
    details: "Templates exist but no UI to execute framework"

  ac2_market_positioning:
    status: "INCOMPLETE"
    details: "Analysis engine exists with mocks only, no API integration"

  ac3_concept_development:
    status: "INCOMPLETE"
    details: "30-min session logic works but no user interface"

  ac4_idea_documentation:
    status: "PARTIAL"
    details: "ConceptDocument component exists but not integrated"

  ac5_progress_tracking:
    status: "INCOMPLETE"
    details: "Logic exists but no visual progress components"

# Quality Metrics
quality_metrics:
  code_coverage: "N/A - Missing components cannot be tested"
  security_compliance: "PARTIAL - Database security excellent, API security not implemented"
  performance: "UNKNOWN - Cannot test performance without functional UI"
  maintainability: "GOOD - Existing code is well-structured"

# Detailed Findings
findings:
  critical_issues:
    - issue: "Missing React Components"
      description: "NewIdeaPathway.tsx, IdeationPhase.tsx, MarketExploration.tsx not found"
      impact: "Users cannot interact with pathway"

    - issue: "No API Integration"
      description: "/api/bmad/route.ts does not exist"
      impact: "Backend logic cannot be accessed by frontend"

    - issue: "Test-Reality Mismatch"
      description: "E2E tests reference UI elements that don't exist"
      impact: "Tests provide false confidence in implementation"

  quality_positives:
    - "Excellent pathway orchestration logic in new-idea-pathway.ts"
    - "Comprehensive template system with detailed AI prompts"
    - "Proper database design with RLS and performance optimization"
    - "Clean TypeScript interfaces and type safety"
    - "Good separation of concerns in business logic"

# Required Actions
required_actions:
  blocking:
    - "Create missing React pathway components"
    - "Implement API endpoints for session management"
    - "Connect UI to business logic and database"
    - "Replace mock analysis with Claude API integration"
    - "Fix E2E tests to match actual implementation"

  recommended:
    - "Add error boundaries for component failures"
    - "Implement session persistence across browser refreshes"
    - "Add performance monitoring for timing constraints"
    - "Create component documentation/storybook"

# Developer Feedback
developer_feedback: |
  Strong architectural foundation demonstrates good understanding of requirements.
  The pathway logic, time management, and phase transitions are excellently implemented.
  Focus needed on UI component creation and API integration to complete the user value chain.

  This appears to be scope completion rather than quality issues - the existing code
  quality is high. The developer should continue with UI implementation using the
  solid backend foundation already built.

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - "Return story to development for UI component completion"
  - "Maintain current backend architecture - it's well designed"
  - "Add acceptance tests for each UI component as they're built"
  - "Consider breaking remaining work into sub-tasks for better tracking"

# Dependencies
dependencies:
  - "Story 2.1 completion (pathway selection interface)"
  - "Claude API integration setup"
  - "Component library standards documentation"

# Next Review
next_review:
  trigger: "After UI components and API endpoints implemented"
  focus: "End-to-end user journey and integration testing"
  estimated_timeline: "1-2 development cycles"
