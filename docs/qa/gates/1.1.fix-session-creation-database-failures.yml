  summary: >
    Story 1.1 successfully resolves all database failures in BMad Method session operations.
    Critical bugs have been identified and fixed, error handling has been significantly
    enhanced, and comprehensive test coverage validates the implementation. The changes
    are low-risk, backward compatible, and provide immediate value to users experiencing
    database connection issues.

  next_steps:
    - "Deploy to production environment"
    - "Monitor error metrics for 24 hours"
    - "Address minor test mock issues in next maintenance cycle"
    - "Consider expanding error handling patterns to other database operations"
