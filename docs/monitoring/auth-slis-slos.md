## Overview

This document defines Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the ThinkHaven authentication system. These metrics provide measurable targets for system reliability and user experience.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### 1. Authentication Success Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of successful authentication attempts over total attempts

**Measurement**:
```
Success Rate = (Successful Authentications / Total Authentication Attempts) × 100
```

**Data Source**:
- Authentication event logs
- Metrics collector aggregation
- Time windows: 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d

**Calculation Details**:
- **Successful**: Events with `event_type: 'auth_success'`
- **Total Attempts**: Max of initiation events or (success + failure) events
- **Exclusions**: Monitoring system health checks, admin testing

### 2. Authentication Latency

**Definition**: Time from authentication initiation to completion

**Measurement**:
```
P50, P95, P99 latency in milliseconds
Average latency over time window
```

**Data Source**:
- Event timestamps (initiation to success/failure)
- Client-side measurement when available
- Server-side processing time

**Calculation Details**:
- **Start**: User clicks login button or submits form
- **End**: User reaches dashboard or receives error
- **Includes**: Network time, OAuth provider time, database time
- **Excludes**: User think time, client rendering time

### 3. Authentication Availability

**Definition**: Percentage of time authentication service is operational

**Measurement**:
```
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100
```

**Data Source**:
- Health check endpoints
- System monitoring
- Error rate thresholds

**Downtime Definition**:
- Success rate < 50% for 5+ consecutive minutes
- Complete service unavailability
- Critical system failures affecting all users

### 4. Error Rate by Category

**Definition**: Percentage of authentication attempts resulting in specific error types

**Measurement**:
```
Error Rate = (Errors of Type X / Total Attempts) × 100
```

**Categories**:
- PKCE verification errors
- OAuth provider errors
- Network connectivity errors
- Invalid credential errors
- System/database errors

### 5. Time to Recovery

**Definition**: Duration from incident detection to service restoration

**Measurement**:
```
MTTR = Total Recovery Time / Number of Incidents
```

**Phases**:
- **Detection**: Alert triggers to acknowledgment
- **Response**: Acknowledgment to mitigation start
- **Resolution**: Mitigation start to service restoration
- **Recovery**: Service restoration to full operation

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Primary SLOs

#### Authentication Success Rate
| Time Window | Target SLO | Alert Threshold |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 hour | ≥ 99.0% | < 97.0% |
| 24 hours | ≥ 99.5% | < 98.0% |
| 7 days | ≥ 99.7% | < 99.0% |
| 30 days | ≥ 99.8% | < 99.5% |

**Rationale**: High reliability is critical for user experience and business continuity.

#### Authentication Latency
| Metric | Target SLO | Alert Threshold |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| P95 Latency | ≤ 3.0 seconds | > 5.0 seconds |
| P99 Latency | ≤ 8.0 seconds | > 10.0 seconds |
| Average Latency | ≤ 2.0 seconds | > 3.0 seconds |

**Rationale**: Users expect fast authentication flows. Industry standard for web authentication is 2-3 seconds.

#### Service Availability
| Time Window | Target SLO | Alert Threshold |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Monthly | ≥ 99.9% (43 minutes downtime) | < 99.5% |
| Quarterly | ≥ 99.95% (2.2 hours downtime) | < 99.8% |
| Annually | ≥ 99.98% (1.8 hours downtime) | < 99.9% |

**Rationale**: Authentication is a critical service requiring high availability.

### Secondary SLOs

#### Error Rate by Category
| Error Type | Target SLO | Alert Threshold |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| PKCE Errors | ≤ 1.0% | > 3.0% |
| OAuth Provider | ≤ 0.5% | > 2.0% |
| Network Errors | ≤ 0.3% | > 1.0% |
| Invalid Credentials | ≤ 5.0% | > 10.0% |
| System Errors | ≤ 0.1% | > 0.5% |

#### Time to Recovery
| Incident Severity | Target MTTR | Alert Threshold |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Critical (P1) | ≤ 30 minutes | > 60 minutes |
| High (P2) | ≤ 4 hours | > 8 hours |
| Medium (P3) | ≤ 24 hours | > 48 hours |

## Error Budget Policy

### Monthly Error Budget Calculation

**Authentication Success Rate Budget**:
```
Error Budget = (100% - SLO) × Total Requests
Example: (100% - 99.5%) × 10,000 requests = 50 failed requests allowed
```

**Latency Budget**:
```
Slow Request Budget = (100% - P95 SLO compliance) × Total Requests
Example: 5% of requests can exceed 3-second latency target
```

### Error Budget Consumption

#### When 50% of Monthly Budget is Consumed
- **Actions**: Increase monitoring frequency
- **Focus**: Identify trends and early warning signs
- **Planning**: Prepare improvement initiatives

#### When 75% of Monthly Budget is Consumed
- **Actions**: Freeze non-critical deployments
- **Focus**: Immediate reliability improvements
- **Communication**: Alert engineering leadership

#### When 90% of Monthly Budget is Consumed
- **Actions**: Halt all feature development
- **Focus**: Only reliability and bug fixes
- **Escalation**: Executive leadership notification

#### When 100% of Monthly Budget is Exhausted
- **Actions**: Incident response mode
- **Focus**: Immediate service restoration
- **Communication**: Customer notification required

## Appendix

### Calculation Examples

#### Success Rate Calculation
```
Time Window: 1 hour
Total Attempts: 1,000
Successful: 995
Success Rate: (995/1000) × 100 = 99.5%
SLO Status: PASS (≥ 99.0%)
```

#### Error Budget Consumption
```
Monthly Attempts: 100,000
SLO Target: 99.5%
Error Budget: 500 failures allowed
Current Failures: 200
Budget Consumed: (200/500) × 100 = 40%
Status: HEALTHY
```

#### MTTR Calculation
```
Incident 1: 15 minutes
Incident 2: 45 minutes
Incident 3: 20 minutes
MTTR: (15+45+20)/3 = 26.7 minutes
SLO Status: PASS (≤ 30 minutes)
```
