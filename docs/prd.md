- [User Interface Design Goals](./prd/3-ui-goals.md) - UI/UX vision and interaction paradigms
- [Technical Architecture](./prd/4-technical-architecture.md) - Current tech stack and integration approach
- [Epic Structure](./prd/5-epic-structure.md) - Epic breakdown and story organization

### Status & Implementation Shards
- [Current Implementation Status](./prd/6-implementation-status.md) - Brownfield analysis and current state

## Executive Summary

The ideally.co platform represents a **Strategic Thinking Workspace** that combines:

### **Foundation Vision** (Historical PRD)
- Innovative "Choose-Your-Adventure" AI coaching platform using bMAD Method
- Dual-pane experience: conversational AI coaching (left) + visual canvas (right)
- 30-minute structured strategic sessions with transparent persona adaptation
- Open-source extensible framework for community-driven coaching patterns

### **Current Implementation Status** (Brownfield Analysis)
- **Existing Foundation**: Working Next.js 15 application with Supabase auth and comprehensive database schema
- **Critical Gap**: Claude Sonnet 4 integration missing (currently hardcoded simulation responses)
- **Target**: Transform foundation into fully functional AI-powered strategic coaching platform

### **Hybrid Approach Benefits**
1. **Leverages Existing Investment**: Builds on solid technical foundation
2. **Maintains Vision**: Preserves strategic goals from original PRD
3. **Addresses Reality**: Focuses on actual technical implementation gaps
4. **Enables Agile Delivery**: Clear epic/story structure for AI agent execution
