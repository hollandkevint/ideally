# Archive - Historical & Outdated Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Do not use archived documentation for current development work**

This directory contains historical documents and outdated implementation guides that no longer reflect the current production state of thinkhaven.

## üìö **Archive Contents**

### **outdated-implementation-docs/**
**Status:** OUTDATED - Do not use for current development

These documents were written when the platform was in a foundation state and incorrectly suggest that Claude integration and BMad Method features need to be implemented:

- `TECHNICAL-GUIDE.md` - Claims Claude integration is missing (it's actually deployed)
- `IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` - Treats working features as TODO items

**Problem:** These guides suggest the platform needs basic AI integration when it's actually a complete BMad Method strategic coaching system with full Claude Sonnet 4 integration.

### **historical/**
**Status:** Historical reference - Original vision and planning documents

Contains original planning documents and user stories that were successfully implemented:

- `reference/` - Original product vision and architecture goals
- `stories/` - Individual feature specifications (all implemented)
- `brownfield-architecture.md` - Original system analysis

**Value:** These documents show the evolution from concept to production and can provide context for future enhancements, but should not be used as current implementation guides.
