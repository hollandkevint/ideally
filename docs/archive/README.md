# Archive - Historical & Outdated Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Do not use archived documentation for current development work**

This directory contains historical documents and outdated implementation guides that no longer reflect the current production state of thinkhaven.

## üìö **Archive Contents**

### **2025-status-snapshots/** ‚≠ê NEW
**Status:** Historical tracking snapshots from 2025 development

Consolidated status documents from various milestones:
- Implementation status snapshots (5 files consolidated)
- Cleanup status tracking (2 files consolidated)
- BMAD implementation completion markers

**Purpose:** Preserved for historical reference showing project progression.

### **session-summaries/** ‚≠ê NEW
**Status:** Consolidated development session documentation

Quarterly summaries of major development sessions:
- **2025-Q3-sessions.md** - September sessions covering Chat API success and BMAD deployment
- Consolidates 13 files (~2,700 lines) into single 400-line summary + references

**Purpose:** Maintains session history in compressed, discoverable format.

### **milestones-2025/** ‚≠ê NEW
**Status:** Implementation milestone summaries from Epic 2 & 3

Detailed technical documentation for major features:
- Story 3.1 - Framework Export System implementation
- Story 2.6 - Canvas Visual Workspace implementation

**Purpose:** Preserves technical specifications, performance benchmarks, and lessons learned.

### **code-artifacts/** ‚≠ê NEW
**Status:** Orphaned code files relocated from docs root

Code files that were misplaced in `/docs`:
- `002_bmad_analytics_schema.sql` (464 lines)
- `bmad-analytics-service.ts` (679 lines)
- `ab-testing-service.ts` (886 lines)
- `developer-dashboard-components.tsx` (743 lines)

**Purpose:** Preserves code artifacts while removing them from documentation hierarchy.

### **outdated-implementation-docs/**
**Status:** OUTDATED - Do not use for current development

These documents were written when the platform was in a foundation state and incorrectly suggest that Claude integration and BMad Method features need to be implemented:

- `TECHNICAL-GUIDE.md` - Claims Claude integration is missing (it's actually deployed)
- `IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` - Treats working features as TODO items

**Problem:** These guides suggest the platform needs basic AI integration when it's actually a complete BMad Method strategic coaching system with full Claude Sonnet 4 integration.

### **historical/**
**Status:** Historical reference - Original vision and planning documents

Contains original planning documents and reference materials:

- `reference/` - Original product vision (prd-bmad.md, architecture-aspirational.md)
- `brownfield-architecture.md` - Original system analysis
- ~~`stories/`~~ ‚Üí **MOVED to `/stories/archive/historical/`** for unified story timeline

**Value:** These documents show the evolution from concept to production and can provide context for future enhancements, but should not be used as current implementation guides.

### **sessions-2025-09-29/** & **qa-revamp-2025-09-30/**
**Status:** Original session files (summarized in `session-summaries/`)

Detailed session logs preserved for reference:
- September 29: Chat API implementation (5 files, 904 lines)
- September 25-30: QA revamp & BMAD deployment (8 files, ~1,800 lines)

**Note:** See `session-summaries/2025-Q3-sessions.md` for consolidated overview.
