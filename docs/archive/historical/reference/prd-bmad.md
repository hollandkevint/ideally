# bMAD Method Analyst Web Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create an innovative "Choose-Your-Adventure" AI coaching platform using bMAD Method as foundation with extensible coaching techniques
- Enable interactive dual-pane experience: conversational AI coaching + visual canvas for wireframing, Mermaid diagrams, and concept iteration
- Provide "30-minute product coach" experience that adapts persona transparently based on user needs and session evolution
- Democratize access to structured strategic thinking through adaptive AI that combines multiple coaching methodologies
- Build open-source extensible framework allowing community contributions of new coaching patterns and techniques
- Create seamless workflow handoffs between different coaching modes and visualization tools for comprehensive idea development

### Background Context
The ideally.co platform combines the proven bMAD Method foundation with an innovative dual-pane interface that revolutionizes how strategic thinking happens. Drawing from the success of strategy consultants who transformed $15K engagements into $50K validated outcomes, this platform addresses the core problem: current AI tools provide unstructured conversations while traditional tools lack intelligence.

The platform features:
- **Adaptive AI Persona:** Transparently evolves during sessions from initial brainstorming through strategic validation
- **Dual-Pane Experience:** Conversational coaching (left) + visual canvas (right) for wireframing, Mermaid diagrams, and concept iteration
- **Choose-Your-Adventure Flow:** Users select their ideation path (new idea, business model problem, feature refinement) with tailored coaching approaches
- **Open-Source Extensibility:** Community-driven coaching patterns and techniques beyond bMAD foundation

**Target Users** (expanded from strategy consultant insights):
- **Independent Consultants** seeking to scale from 2 to 10+ clients monthly through structured workflows
- **Entrepreneurs** validating ideas before significant investment, reducing pivot time from months to weeks
- **Product Managers** facilitating strategic planning sessions with visual documentation capabilities
- **Professional Coaches** delivering structured client sessions with exportable outcomes
- **Corporate Innovation Teams** conducting rapid ideation with integrated visualization tools

This represents a new category: **"Strategic Thinking Workspace"** - combining probabilistic exploration (AI) with deterministic structure (workflows) and visual iteration capabilities, enabling users to move from raw ideas to validated business concepts in structured 30-minute sessions.
