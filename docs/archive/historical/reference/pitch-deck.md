*Meet Mary: Your AI Business Analyst Partner*

**The bMAD Method - Transforming Strategic Analysis from Art into Science**

---

### Slide 2: The Problem (Pain Point)
**"Strategic analysis lacks systematic methodology"**
*- Business Analysts and Strategy Consultants*

**The Reality:**
- Strategic brainstorming produces circular discussions  
- Analysis lacks evidence-based foundations
- Inconsistent frameworks across projects
- Manual documentation consumes valuable thinking time
- Missing critical perspectives leads to incomplete analysis
- **Result**: Surface-level insights, weak strategic recommendations

---

### Slide 3: The Current Broken Process
**Traditional Strategic Analysis:**
1. **Unstructured brainstorming**: Hope the best ideas surface
2. **Generic frameworks**: Apply SWOT to every situation  
3. **Manual research**: Reinvent methodology each time
4. **Inconsistent documentation**: No systematic approach
4. **Outcome**: Shallow analysis, missed insights, weak recommendations

**Current Tools:**
- ❌ **ChatGPT**: Unstructured conversations, no methodology
- ❌ **Miro/Mural**: Visual collaboration, no analytical rigor
- ❌ **Generic templates**: One-size-fits-all approaches
