## Dev Notes

Based on the architecture document and hybrid MVP scope approach, here are the implementation details:

### Technical Stack Configuration (Hybrid MVP)

**Layout System:** CSS Grid with fixed 60/40 split
- No drag-to-resize complexity for MVP
- Clean separation of chat and canvas areas
- Responsive breakpoint at 768px for mobile stacking

**State Management Architecture:**
```typescript
// Essential state bridge for dual-pane sync
interface DualPaneState {
  chat: {
    messages: ChatMessage[];
    currentPhase: 'exploration' | 'validation' | 'planning';
  };
  canvas: {
    elements: CanvasElement[];
    viewport: { x: number; y: number; zoom: number };
  };
  sync: {
    contextBridges: ContextBridge[];
    lastUpdate: timestamp;
  };
}

// Simplified state bridge component
const useDualPaneSync = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useStore<DualPaneState>();
  
  const syncChatToCanvas = (message: ChatMessage) => {
    // Basic sync logic - suggest canvas elements from chat
  };
  
  const syncCanvasToChat = (element: CanvasElement) => {
    // Basic sync logic - reference canvas in chat context
  };
};
```

**Responsive Design (Simplified):**
```css
/* Desktop: Fixed 60/40 split */
.dual-pane-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 60fr 40fr;
  height: 100vh;
}

/* Mobile: Simple vertical stacking */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .dual-pane-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 50vh 50vh;
  }
}
```

**Component Architecture:**
```typescript
// Main dual-pane container
<DualPaneWorkspace>
  <ChatPane />
  <CanvasPane />
  <StateBridge />
</DualPaneWorkspace>

// Essential state sync without complex real-time
const StateBridge = () => {
  // Simplified sync - updates on user actions, not real-time
  // Debounced updates to prevent performance issues
};
```

**Key Hybrid MVP Decisions:**
- Fixed layout eliminates resize complexity while preserving dual-pane experience
- Essential state sync kept for core value prop validation
- Simplified mobile ensures idea capture capability
- Professional loading/error states maintain user trust

### Testing

**Testing Standards (Focused):**

**Test File Location:** 
- Dual-pane tests: `apps/web/tests/dual-pane/`
- State sync tests: `apps/web/tests/state-sync/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Frontend:** Vitest + Testing Library for dual-pane components
- **E2E:** Playwright for cross-pane interaction testing

**Specific Hybrid MVP Testing Requirements:**
- Test fixed 60/40 layout across desktop screen sizes
- Verify mobile vertical stacking functionality
- Test basic state sync between chat and canvas panes
- Validate loading states and error boundaries
- Test dual-pane workflow: chat message â†’ canvas suggestion

**Performance Requirements:**
- Layout rendering under 100ms on desktop
- Mobile stacking transition under 200ms
- State sync updates within 500ms of user action
- Memory usage stable with extended dual-pane sessions

**Benefits of hybrid scope:**
- 40% faster development than full scope
- Preserves core value proposition validation
- Maintains professional user experience
- Clear path for post-validation enhancements

**Post-MVP enhancement priority:**
1. Drag-to-resize divider (user customization)
2. Smooth animations (polish and delight)
3. Keyboard shortcuts (power user efficiency)
4. Advanced mobile optimizations
