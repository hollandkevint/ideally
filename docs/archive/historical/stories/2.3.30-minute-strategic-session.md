## Technical Implementation Notes

### Session Management Architecture

```typescript
// Session timer and phase management
interface BmadSession {
  id: string;
  startTime: Date;
  currentPhase: BmadPhase;
  phaseProgress: PhaseProgress[];
  timeAllocations: PhaseTimeAllocation[];
  extensionOptions: SessionExtension[];
}

enum BmadPhase {
  CONTEXT = 'context',
  EXPLORATION = 'exploration', 
  ANALYSIS = 'analysis',
  ACTION_PLANNING = 'action_planning'
}

class SessionOrchestrator {
  private session: BmadSession;
  private bmadMethod: BmadMethodService;
  
  async advancePhase(userInput: string): Promise<PhaseTransition> {
    const currentProgress = await this.assessPhaseCompletion();
    if (currentProgress.readyForNext) {
      return await this.transitionToNextPhase();
    }
    return await this.continueCurrentPhase();
  }
}
```

### Visual Progress Integration

```tsx
// Session progress component
const SessionProgress = ({ session }: { session: BmadSession }) => {
  return (
    <div className="session-progress">
      <SessionTimer duration={30} elapsed={session.elapsed} />
      <PhaseTracker 
        phases={session.phases}
        currentPhase={session.currentPhase}
      />
      <BMadTemplateProgress 
        templates={session.activeTemplates}
        completion={session.templateCompletion}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
