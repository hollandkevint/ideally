# Develop Growth Strategy Task

## Purpose

To create a comprehensive growth strategy focusing on user acquisition, activation, retention, and monetization (AARRR) using product-led growth principles and data-driven experimentation frameworks.

## Inputs

- Current product metrics and user analytics
- Customer segmentation and behavior data
- Market analysis and competitive landscape
- Business objectives and growth targets
- Product capabilities and technical constraints
- Available resources and team structure

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Establish Growth Framework

#### 1.1 North Star Metric Definition

**<critical_rule>Choose one primary metric that represents customer value creation</critical_rule>**

Define your North Star:

- [ ] What action represents meaningful value for customers?
- [ ] How does this metric correlate with business success?
- [ ] Can teams directly influence this metric through product changes?
- [ ] Is it simple enough for everyone to understand?

Examples:

- "Weekly active users completing [core action]"
- "Monthly revenue from customers achieving [value milestone]"
- "Number of teams successfully [using core feature] weekly"

#### 1.2 AARRR Funnel Analysis

Map your current funnel performance:

**Acquisition**: How users discover and sign up

- [ ] Traffic sources and conversion rates
- [ ] Cost per acquisition by channel
- [ ] Sign-up funnel drop-off points
- [ ] Lead quality and source attribution

**Activation**: First value realization

- [ ] Onboarding completion rates
- [ ] Time to first value
- [ ] Feature adoption in first session
- [ ] Setup completion rates

**Retention**: Continued product usage

- [ ] Day 1, 7, 30 retention rates
- [ ] Feature stickiness analysis
- [ ] Churn patterns and reasons
- [ ] Engagement scoring models

**Revenue**: Monetization optimization

- [ ] Conversion to paid rates
- [ ] Average revenue per user
- [ ] Pricing sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Expansion revenue opportunities

**Referral**: Viral growth mechanisms

- [ ] Net Promoter Score trends
- [ ] Referral rates and attribution
- [ ] Viral coefficient calculation
- [ ] Word-of-mouth drivers

### 2. Customer Segmentation Analysis

#### 2.1 Behavioral Segmentation

Identify key user segments:

- [ ] Power users (high engagement, high value)
- [ ] Core users (regular usage, moderate value)
- [ ] Casual users (occasional usage, low value)
- [ ] At-risk users (declining engagement)
- [ ] Churned users (stopped using product)

#### 2.2 Value-Based Segmentation

- [ ] High-value customers (revenue contribution)
- [ ] Growth customers (expansion potential)
- [ ] Advocacy customers (referral generation)
- [ ] Test customers (feedback and validation)

#### 2.3 Journey Stage Segmentation

- [ ] New users (first 30 days)
- [ ] Developing users (months 1-6)
- [ ] Mature users (6+ months)
- [ ] Champion users (advocates and experts)

### 3. Growth Opportunity Identification

#### 3.1 Funnel Optimization Opportunities

For each AARRR stage, identify:

- [ ] Biggest drop-off points
- [ ] Benchmark comparisons
- [ ] Quick win opportunities
- [ ] High-impact improvement areas

#### 3.2 Product-Led Growth Levers

- [ ] Virality mechanisms (sharing, collaboration)
- [ ] Network effects opportunities
- [ ] Self-serve onboarding improvements
- [ ] In-product upgrade prompts
- [ ] Feature-based acquisition (freemium model)

#### 3.3 Channel Optimization

- [ ] Underperforming acquisition channels
- [ ] High-potential new channels
- [ ] Channel-specific conversion optimization
- [ ] Cross-channel attribution improvements

### 4. Prioritization Framework

#### 4.1 Impact vs. Effort Matrix

Rate each opportunity:

- **High Impact, Low Effort**: Quick wins (do first)
- **High Impact, High Effort**: Major projects (plan carefully)
- **Low Impact, Low Effort**: Small improvements (fill gaps)
- **Low Impact, High Effort**: Avoid (unless strategic)

#### 4.2 ICE Scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

Score each initiative 1-10:

- **Impact**: Potential effect on North Star metric
- **Confidence**: Certainty that initiative will work
- **Ease**: Difficulty of implementation

Total ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

### 5. Growth Experiment Design

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Framework

For each experiment:

```
We believe that [change/feature]
Will result in [outcome]
Because [assumption about user behavior]
We'll measure success by [metric]
```

#### 5.2 Experiment Prioritization

- [ ] Statistical power calculations
- [ ] Minimum detectable effect sizes
- [ ] Sample size requirements
- [ ] Test duration planning
- [ ] Resource allocation per experiment

#### 5.3 Testing Roadmap

Create quarterly experiment schedule:

- [ ] High-priority experiments (proven methodologies)
