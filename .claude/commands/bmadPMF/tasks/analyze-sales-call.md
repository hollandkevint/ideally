When this command is used, execute the following task:

# Analyze Sales Call Task

## Purpose

To systematically extract insights from sales conversations that reveal demand patterns, friction points, and opportunities for case study refinement. Every call is data that brings you closer to product-market fit.

## Inputs

- Recording or detailed notes from recent sales call
- Current case study version used in the call
- Prospect information (role, company, context)
- Call outcome (next steps, objections, interest level)
- Your gut feeling about what went well/poorly

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Call Setup Documentation

Record the context for proper analysis:

- **Prospect Profile**: Role, company size, industry
- **How They Found You**: Inbound/outbound, referral source
- **Pre-Call Research**: What you knew going in
- **Their Stated Interest**: Why they took the meeting
- **Case Study Version**: Which variation you presented

### 2. Energy and Engagement Mapping

Track engagement throughout the call:

#### 2.1 High Energy Moments

- [ ] When did they lean in or get excited?
- [ ] What specific words/phrases sparked interest?
- [ ] Which slides/sections generated questions?
- [ ] When did they start selling themselves?

#### 2.2 Energy Drops

- [ ] Where did enthusiasm wane?
- [ ] Which sections felt like pushing uphill?
- [ ] When did they disengage or multitask?
- [ ] What triggered skepticism or doubt?

### 3. Question Analysis

Document and interpret every question asked:

| Question Asked                       | Underlying Concern    | What This Reveals          |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| "How long does implementation take?" | Risk/effort concern   | Need clearer "How" section |
| "Who else uses this?"                | Social proof needed   | Add customer examples      |
| "Can it integrate with X?"           | Technical feasibility | Address in options         |

#### 3.1 Question Categories

- **Clarification**: What wasn't clear?
- **Validation**: What seemed too good to be true?
- **Comparison**: How are they evaluating options?
- **Implementation**: Concerns about execution?
- **Pricing**: Value justification needs?

### 4. Project and Context Validation

Verify your assumptions about their situation:

- **Actual Project**: How did they describe what they're trying to accomplish?
- **Real Context**: What's actually driving urgency (or lack thereof)?
- **True Options**: What alternatives are they genuinely considering?
- **Success Definition**: How do they define winning?

Note any mismatches with your case study.

### 5. Friction Point Identification

Identify specific moments of resistance:

#### 5.1 Explicit Objections

- "That seems complicated"
- "We don't have budget for that"
- "I'm not sure my team would adopt this"
- "We tried something similar before"

#### 5.2 Implicit Concerns

- Long pauses after certain points
- Deflecting to other topics
- "I need to think about it" (where specifically?)
- Body language shifts (if video)

### 6. Demand Signal Assessment

Rate the strength of demand signals:

**Strong Demand Indicators:**

- [ ] Asking about implementation timeline
- [ ] Discussing internal approval process
- [ ] Requesting references or case studies
- [ ] Calculating ROI during the call
- [ ] Introducing other stakeholders

**Weak Demand Indicators:**

- [ ] Vague interest in "learning more"
- [ ] No discussion of timeline
- [ ] Focusing on features vs. outcomes
- [ ] No mention of current pain/urgency
- [ ] Passive listening without engagement

### 7. Case Study Resonance Scoring

Score each case study section (1-5):

1. **Project**: Did they recognize the project?
2. **Context**: Did the "why now" resonate?
3. **Options**: Were these their actual options?
4. **Results**: Were outcomes compelling?
5. **How**: Did the path seem credible?
6. **What**: Was the offer clear and attractive?

### 8. Key Insights Extraction

Synthesize the most important learnings:

#### 8.1 Demand Insights

- What they're REALLY trying to accomplish
- Why it's actually urgent (or not)
- Who else is involved in this decision

#### 8.2 Positioning Insights

- How they categorize your solution
- What they compare you to
- Where you fit in their options

#### 8.3 Messaging Insights

- Words/phrases that resonated
- Concepts that confused
- Stories that connected

### 9. Action Items

Based on analysis, identify specific improvements:

**Immediate Tweaks:**

- [ ] Reword confusion points
- [ ] Add missing information
- [ ] Adjust positioning
- [ ] Clarify pricing/terms

**Deeper Changes:**

- [ ] Refocus on different project
- [ ] Adjust target customer profile
- [ ] Rebuild options framework
- [ ] Redesign results promise

**Testing Priorities:**

- What to test in next call
- Which variation might work better
- New questions to ask upfront

### 10. Pattern Tracking

Add to your pattern database:

- **Call Type**: Similar to which previous calls?
- **Outcome Pattern**: Common resolution path?
- **Learning Category**: Demand, positioning, or execution?
- **Confidence Level**: How sure are you about insights?

## Output

- Completed call analysis template
- Specific case study improvements identified
- Updated demand hypotheses
- Questions for next calls
- Pattern recognition notes

## Success Criteria

- Clear understanding of why call went as it did
- Actionable improvements to case study identified
- Demand signals properly interpreted
- Patterns starting to emerge across calls
- Excitement about testing improvements

## Follow-up Actions

- Update case study based on insights
- Share learnings with team/advisors
- Schedule next batch of calls
- Refine pre-call qualification
- Adjust outreach messaging if needed

## Templates and Tools

- Call recording software recommendations

- Look for patterns across 3-5 calls, not just one
- When confused, it's usually a demand mismatch
- Trust energy levels over polite words
