## Inputs

- Completed case study (6 parts)
- Target customer profile
- Common objections/questions from prior calls
- Competitive landscape understanding
- Your unique advantages

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Pitch Structure Design

- Permission to understand their situation
- Transition to discovery

**Discovery (5-10 minutes)**

- Understand their current state
- Identify their project priority
- Uncover their context/urgency
- Explore their options thinking

**Case Study Presentation (10-15 minutes)**

- Share relevant customer story
- Draw parallels to their situation
- Show the path to results
- Present the specific offer

**Discussion & Close (10-15 minutes)**

- Address questions and concerns
- Explore fit and timeline
- Agree on next steps
- Set clear follow-up

### 2. Create the Slide Deck

Build a minimal, story-driven deck:

#### Slide 1: Title Slide

- Your company name
- "How [Customer Type] [Achieve Result]"
- Your name and contact
- **<important_note>Keep it simple and outcome-focused</important_note>**

#### Slide 2: The Situation

```
"When we talk to [role], we typically hear about
one of these projects..."

• Project Option 1
• Project Option 2
• Project Option 3

"Which resonates most with you?"
```

#### Slide 3: The Context

```
"[Customer Name] came to us because..."

[Insert context that created urgency]

"They needed to [achieve outcome] by [timeline]
because [business reason]"

"Sound familiar?"
```

#### Slide 4: The Options

```
"They looked at several options:"

1. [Status Quo] - but [why it wasn't working]
2. [Alternative 1] - but [limitation]
3. [Alternative 2] - but [limitation]
4. [Your Solution] - because [unique advantage]
```

#### Slide 5: The Results

```
"Here's what happened:"

✓ [Immediate outcome]
✓ [30-day achievement]
✓ [90-day transformation]

[Include specific metrics and quotes]
```

#### Slide 6: How It Works

```
"The path to these results:"

Week 1: [First milestone]
Week 2-4: [Implementation phase]
Month 2: [Value realization]
Month 3: [Full transformation]

[Show customer effort vs. your effort]
```

#### Slide 7: What You Get

```
"Here's exactly what's included:"

• [Core deliverable]
• [Support level]
• [Guarantee/risk reversal]
• [Timeline commitment]

Investment: $[X]/month
[Payment terms]
```

#### Slide 8: Next Steps

```
"Typical process from here:"

1. [Decision step]
2. [Internal approval]
3. [Kickoff timeline]
4. [First value date]

"What makes sense for you?"
```

### 3. Develop Discovery Questions

Craft questions that uncover demand:

**Project Questions:**

- "What's the main thing you're trying to accomplish right now?"
- "How would you describe this project internally?"
- "What does success look like specifically?"

**Context Questions:**

- "Why is this becoming a priority now vs. last quarter?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get solved?"
- "Who else cares about this internally?"

**Options Questions:**

- "What options have you considered so far?"
- "What's worked or not worked in the past?"
- "How are you thinking about build vs. buy?"

**Timeline Questions:**

- "When do you need to see results?"
- "What's driving that timeline?"
- "What's the decision process look like?"

### 4. Master Transitions

Create smooth conversation flows:

**From Discovery to Case Study:**
"That's really helpful context. This reminds me a lot of [Customer Name]'s situation..."

**From Problem to Solution:**
"So if I understand correctly, you need to [problem]. Here's how others have solved this..."

**From Interest to Action:**
"Based on what you've shared, it seems like this could be a good fit. What would need to be true for you to move forward?"

### 5. Handle Common Objections

Prepare responses using case study elements:

**"Too expensive"**
→ Return to results and ROI from case study

**"Not sure it'll work for us"**
→ Emphasize similar context and situation

**"Need to think about it"**
→ Explore specific concerns, offer to address

**"Bad timing"**
→ Revisit context and cost of delay

### 6. Design Engagement Techniques

Keep prospects actively involved:

- **Questions Throughout**: "Does this match your experience?"
- **Parallel Drawing**: "How does this compare to your situation?"
- **Mini-Confirmations**: "Make sense so far?"
- **Collaborative Planning**: "What would implementation look like for you?"

### 7. Create Talk Track Variations

Develop versions for different scenarios:

**High-Urgency Version**: Emphasize speed to value
**Risk-Averse Version**: Focus on guarantees and proof
**Price-Sensitive Version**: Highlight ROI and alternatives
**Technical Buyer Version**: Deep dive on implementation

### 8. Build Supporting Materials

Prepare assets for follow-up:

- One-page case study summary
- ROI calculator template
- Implementation timeline
- Reference contact list
- Contract/order form template

### 9. Practice and Refine

Role-play the pitch to improve delivery:

- **Record Yourself**: Listen for energy and clarity
- **Time Each Section**: Stay within attention spans
- **Practice Objections**: Smooth, confident responses
- **Get Feedback**: From team or advisors
- **<critical_rule>The pitch should feel conversational, not scripted</critical_rule>**

### 10. Create Measurement Framework

Track what works:

**Engagement Metrics:**

- Which slides generate questions?
- Where do people lean in?
