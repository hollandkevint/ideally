# ThinkHaven Archive

This directory contains archived files and documentation that are no longer actively used but preserved for historical reference and context.

## Structure

### `legacy-migrations/`
- **MIGRATION_SQL.sql**: Original manual migration script superseded by proper migration files
- **RUN_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Migration instructions for the v1.0 user_workspace table creation

### `releases/`
- **RELEASE-v1.3.0.md**: Release notes for the dual-pane interface foundation (August 27, 2025)

## Archive Policy

Files are archived when they:
1. Are superseded by newer implementations
2. Represent completed project phases
3. Contain valuable historical context but are no longer operationally relevant
4. Would otherwise clutter the main project directory

## Accessing Archived Content

All archived files remain accessible via Git history. This archive serves as a quick reference for:
- Understanding past implementation approaches
- Reviewing completed feature rollouts
- Maintaining institutional knowledge
- Supporting debugging of legacy issues
