## 🎯 **Project Analysis Complete**

Based on my analysis of your `/Users/kthkellogg/Documents/GitHub/ideally.co` project, here's what I found:

### **Current State:**
- **Planning Phase Complete**: Comprehensive PRD, architecture docs, and detailed user stories
- **No Implementation Yet**: No code files (JS/TS), package.json, or development environment
- **Ready to Code**: Story 1.1 (Registration Flow) is fully planned with detailed tasks

### **What's Next - Choose Your Path:**

1. **`*agent dev`** - Transform me into a Development Agent to start building Story 1.1
2. **`*agent pm`** - Switch to Product Management Agent to refine requirements or plan next stories  
3. **`*workflow development`** - Start a structured development workflow with setup, coding, and testing phases
4. **`*workflow-guidance`** - Get personalized help choosing the right approach based on your goals

### **Immediate Next Steps I Recommend:**
Your project is perfectly positioned to start **Story 1.1: Registration Flow** - it has:
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria (8 defined requirements)
- ✅ Detailed technical tasks (66 specific subtasks)
- ✅ Tech stack decisions (NestJS + React + TypeScript)
- ✅ Architecture specifications (Keycloak, Redis, SendGrid)

```
1→# BMad Method — User Guide
     2→
     3→This guide will help you understand and effectively use the BMad Method for agile AI-driven planning and development.
     4→
     5→## The BMad Plan and Execute Workflow
     6→
     7→First, here is the full standard Greenfield Planning + Execution Workflow. Brownfield is very similar, but it's suggested to understand this greenfield first, even if on a simple project before tackling a brownfield project. The BMad Method needs to be installed to the root of your new project folder. For the planning phase, you can optionally perform it with powerful web agents, potentially resulting in higher quality results at a fraction of the cost it would take to complete if providing your own API key or credits in some Agentic tools. For planning, powerful thinking models and larger context - along with working as a partner with the agents will net the best results.
     8→
     9→If you are going to use the BMad Method with a Brownfield project (an existing project), review **[Working in the Brownfield](./working-in-the-brownfield.md)**.
    10→
    11→If the diagrams below don't render, install Markdown All in One along with the Markdown Preview Mermaid Support plugins to VSCode (or one of the forked clones). With these plugins, if you right click on the tab when open, there should be an Open Preview option, or check the IDE documentation.
    12→
    13→### The Planning Workflow (Web UI or Powerful IDE Agents)
    14→
    15→Before development begins, BMad follows a structured planning workflow that's ideally done in web UI for cost efficiency:

    75→
    76→#### Web UI to IDE Transition
    77→
    78→**Critical Transition Point**: Once the PO confirms document alignment, you must switch from web UI to IDE to begin the development workflow:
    79→
    80→1. **Copy Documents to Project**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` are in your project's docs folder (or a custom location you can specify during installation)
    81→2. **Switch to IDE**: Open your project in your preferred Agentic IDE
    82→3. **Document Sharding**: Use the PO agent to shard the PRD and then the Architecture
    83→4. **Begin Development**: Start the Core Development Cycle that follows
    84→
    85→#### Planning Artifacts (Standard Paths)
    86→
    87→\```text
    88→PRD              → docs/prd.md
    89→Architecture     → docs/architecture.md

    95→
    96→### The Core Development Cycle (IDE)
    97→
    98→Once planning is complete and documents are sharded, BMad follows a structured development workflow:

   162→
   163→## Prerequisites
   164→
   165→Before installing BMad Method, ensure you have:
   166→
   167→- **Node.js** ≥ 18, **npm** ≥ 9
   168→- **Git** installed and configured
   169→- **(Optional)** VS Code with "Markdown All in One" + "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extensions
   170→
   171→## Installation
   172→
   173→### Optional
   174→
   175→If you want to do the planning on the web with Claude (Sonnet 4 or Opus), Gemini Gem (2.5 Pro), or Custom GPTs:
   176→
   177→1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
   178→2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt`
   179→3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
   180→4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
   181→5. Type `/help` to see available commands
   182→
   183→### IDE Project Setup
   184→
   185→\```bash
   186→# Interactive installation (recommended)
   187→npx bmad-method install
   188→\```
   189→
   190→## Special Agents
   191→
   192→There are two BMad agents — in the future they'll be consolidated into a single BMad-Master.
   193→
   194→### BMad-Master
   195→
   196→This agent can do any task or command that all other agents can do, aside from actual story implementation. Additionally, this agent can help explain the BMad Method when on the web by accessing the knowledge base and explaining anything to you about the process.
   197→
   198→If you don't want to bother switching between different agents aside from the dev, this is the agent for you. Just remember that as the context grows, the performance of the agent degrades, therefore it is important to instruct the agent to compact the conversation and start a new conversation with the compacted conversation as the initial message. Do this often, preferably after each story is implemented.
   199→
   200→### BMad-Orchestrator
   201→
   202→This agent should NOT be used within the IDE, it is a heavyweight, special-purpose agent that utilizes a lot of context and can morph into any other agent. This exists solely to facilitate the teams within the web bundles. If you use a web bundle you will be greeted by the BMad Orchestrator.
   203→
   204→### How Agents Work
   205→
   206→#### Dependencies System
   207→
   208→Each agent has a YAML section that defines its dependencies:
   209→
   210→\```yaml
   211→dependencies:
   212→  templates:
   213→    - prd-template.md
   214→    - user-story-template.md
   215→  tasks:
   216→    - create-doc.md
   217→    - shard-doc.md
   218→  data:
   219→    - bmad-kb.md
   220→\```
   221→
   222→**Key Points:**
   223→
   224→- Agents only load resources they need (lean context)
   225→- Dependencies are automatically resolved during bundling
   226→- Resources are shared across agents to maintain consistency
   227→
   228→#### Agent Interaction
   229→
   230→**In IDE:**
   231→
   232→\```bash
   233→# Some IDEs, like Cursor or Windsurf for example, utilize manual rules so interaction is done with the '@' symbol
   234→@pm Create a PRD for a task management app
   235→@architect Design the system architecture
   236→@dev Implement the user authentication
   237→
   238→# Some IDEs, like Claude Code, use slash commands instead
   239→/pm Create user stories
   240→/dev Fix the login bug
   241→\```
   242→
   243→#### Interactive Modes
   244→
   245→- **Incremental Mode**: Step-by-step with user input
   246→- **YOLO Mode**: Rapid generation with minimal interaction
   247→
   248→## IDE Integration
   249→
   250→### IDE Best Practices
   251→
   252→- **Context Management**: Keep relevant files only in context, keep files as lean and focused as necessary
   253→- **Agent Selection**: Use appropriate agent for task
   254→- **Iterative Development**: Work in small, focused tasks
   255→- **File Organization**: Maintain clean project structure
   256→- **Commit Regularly**: Save your work frequently

   262→The QA agent in BMad is not just a "senior developer reviewer" - it's a **Test Architect** with deep expertise in test strategy, quality gates, and risk-based testing. Named Quinn, this agent provides advisory authority on quality matters while actively improving code when safe to do so.
   263→
   264→#### Quick Start (Essential Commands)
   265→
   266→\```bash
   267→@qa *risk {story}       # Assess risks before development
   268→@qa *design {story}     # Create test strategy
   269→@qa *trace {story}      # Verify test coverage during dev
   270→@qa *nfr {story}        # Check quality attributes
   271→@qa *review {story}     # Full assessment → writes gate
   272→\```
   273→
   274→#### Command Aliases (Test Architect)
   275→
   276→The documentation uses short forms for convenience. Both styles are valid:
   277→
   278→\```text
   279→*risk    → *risk-profile
   280→*design  → *test-design
   281→*nfr     → *nfr-assess
   282→*trace   → *trace-requirements (or just *trace)
   283→*review  → *review
   284→*gate    → *gate
   285→\```
   286→
   287→### Core Capabilities
   288→
   289→#### 1. Risk Profiling (`*risk`)
   290→
   291→**When:** After story draft, before development begins (earliest intervention point)
   292→
   293→Identifies and assesses implementation risks:
   294→
   295→- **Categories**: Technical, Security, Performance, Data, Business, Operational
   296→- **Scoring**: Probability × Impact analysis (1-9 scale)
   297→- **Mitigation**: Specific strategies for each identified risk
   298→- **Gate Impact**: Risks ≥9 trigger FAIL, ≥6 trigger CONCERNS (see `tasks/risk-profile.md` for authoritative rules)
   299→
   300→#### 2. Test Design (`*design`)
   301→
   302→**When:** After story draft, before development begins (guides what tests to write)
   303→
   304→Creates comprehensive test strategies including:
   305→
   306→- Test scenarios for each acceptance criterion
   307→- Appropriate test level recommendations (unit vs integration vs E2E)
   308→- Risk-based prioritization (P0/P1/P2)
   309→- Test data requirements and mock strategies
   310→- Execution strategies for CI/CD integration
   311→
   312→**Example output:**
   313→
   314→\```yaml
   315→test_summary:
   316→  total: 24
   317→  by_level:
   318→    unit: 15
   319→    integration: 7
   320→    e2e: 2
   321→  by_priority:
   322→    P0: 8 # Must have - linked to critical risks
   323→    P1: 10 # Should have - medium risks
   324→    P2: 6 # Nice to have - low risks
   325→\```
   326→
   327→#### 3. Requirements Tracing (`*trace`)
   328→
   329→**When:** During development (mid-implementation checkpoint)
   330→
   331→Maps requirements to test coverage:
   332→
   333→- Documents which tests validate each acceptance criterion
   334→- Uses Given-When-Then for clarity (documentation only, not BDD code)
   335→- Identifies coverage gaps with severity ratings
   336→- Creates traceability matrix for audit purposes
   337→
   338→#### 4. NFR Assessment (`*nfr`)
   339→
   340→**When:** During development or early review (validate quality attributes)
   341→
   342→Validates non-functional requirements:
   343→
   344→- **Core Four**: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability
   345→- **Evidence-Based**: Looks for actual implementation proof
   346→- **Gate Integration**: NFR failures directly impact quality gates
   347→
   348→#### 5. Comprehensive Test Architecture Review (`*review`)
   349→
   350→**When:** After development complete, story marked "Ready for Review"
   351→
   352→When you run `@qa *review {story}`, Quinn performs:
   353→
   354→- **Requirements Traceability**: Maps every acceptance criterion to its validating tests
   355→- **Test Level Analysis**: Ensures appropriate testing at unit, integration, and E2E levels
   356→- **Coverage Assessment**: Identifies gaps and redundant test coverage
   357→- **Active Refactoring**: Improves code quality directly when safe
   358→- **Quality Gate Decision**: Issues PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL status based on findings
   359→
   360→#### 6. Quality Gates (`*gate`)
   361→
   362→**When:** After review fixes or when gate status needs updating
   363→
   364→Manages quality gate decisions:
   365→
   366→- **Deterministic Rules**: Clear criteria for PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL
   367→- **Parallel Authority**: QA owns gate files in `docs/qa/gates/`
   368→- **Advisory Nature**: Provides recommendations, not blocks
   369→- **Waiver Support**: Documents accepted risks when needed
   370→
   371→**Note:** Gates are advisory; teams choose their quality bar. WAIVED requires reason, approver, and expiry date. See `templates/qa-gate-tmpl.yaml` for schema and `tasks/review-story.md` (gate rules) and `tasks/risk-profile.md` for scoring.
   372→
   373→### Working with the Test Architect
   374→
   375→#### Integration with BMad Workflow
   376→
   377→The Test Architect provides value throughout the entire development lifecycle. Here's when and how to leverage each capability:
   378→
   379→| **Stage**          | **Command** | **When to Use**         | **Value**                  | **Output**                                                     |
   380→| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
   381→| **Story Drafting** | `*risk`     | After SM drafts story   | Identify pitfalls early    | `docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`        |
   382→|                    | `*design`   | After risk assessment   | Guide dev on test strategy | `docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md` |
   383→| **Development**    | `*trace`    | Mid-implementation      | Verify test coverage       | `docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md`       |
   384→|                    | `*nfr`      | While building features | Catch quality issues early | `docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`         |
   385→| **Review**         | `*review`   | Story marked complete   | Full quality assessment    | QA Results in story + gate file                                |
   386→| **Post-Review**    | `*gate`     | After fixing issues     | Update quality decision    | Updated `docs/qa/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml`              |
   387→
   388→#### Example Commands
   389→
   390→\```bash
   391→# Planning Stage - Run these BEFORE development starts
   392→@qa *risk {draft-story}     # What could go wrong?
   393→@qa *design {draft-story}   # What tests should we write?
   394→
   395→# Development Stage - Run these DURING coding
   396→@qa *trace {story}          # Are we testing everything?
   397→@qa *nfr {story}            # Are we meeting quality standards?
   398→
   399→# Review Stage - Run when development complete
   400→@qa *review {story}         # Comprehensive assessment + refactoring
   401→
   402→# Post-Review - Run after addressing issues
   403→@qa *gate {story}           # Update gate status
   404→\```
   405→
   406→### Quality Standards Enforced
   407→
   408→Quinn enforces these test quality principles:
   409→
   410→- **No Flaky Tests**: Ensures reliability through proper async handling
   411→- **No Hard Waits**: Dynamic waiting strategies only
   412→- **Stateless & Parallel-Safe**: Tests run independently
   413→- **Self-Cleaning**: Tests manage their own test data
   414→- **Appropriate Test Levels**: Unit for logic, integration for interactions, E2E for journeys
   415→- **Explicit Assertions**: Keep assertions in tests, not helpers
   416→
   417→### Gate Status Meanings
   418→
   419→- **PASS**: All critical requirements met, no blocking issues
   420→- **CONCERNS**: Non-critical issues found, team should review
   421→- **FAIL**: Critical issues that should be addressed (security risks, missing P0 tests)
   422→- **WAIVED**: Issues acknowledged but explicitly accepted by team
   423→
   424→### Special Situations
   425→
   426→**High-Risk Stories:**
   427→
   428→- Always run `*risk` and `*design` before development starts
   429→- Consider mid-development `*trace` and `*nfr` checkpoints
   430→
   431→**Complex Integrations:**
   432→
   433→- Run `*trace` during development to ensure all integration points tested
   434→- Follow up with `*nfr` to validate performance across integrations
   435→
   436→**Performance-Critical:**
   437→
   438→- Run `*nfr` early and often during development
   439→- Don't wait until review to discover performance issues
   440→
   441→**Brownfield/Legacy Code:**
   442→
   443→- Start with `*risk` to identify regression dangers
   444→- Use `*review` with extra focus on backward compatibility
   445→
   446→### Best Practices
   447→
   448→- **Early Engagement**: Run `*design` and `*risk` during story drafting
   449→- **Risk-Based Focus**: Let risk scores drive test prioritization
   450→- **Iterative Improvement**: Use QA feedback to improve future stories
   451→- **Gate Transparency**: Share gate decisions with the team
   452→- **Continuous Learning**: QA documents patterns for team knowledge sharing
   453→- **Brownfield Care**: Pay extra attention to regression risks in existing systems
   454→
   455→### Output Paths Reference
   456→
   457→Quick reference for where Test Architect outputs are stored:
   458→
   459→\```text
   460→*risk-profile  → docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   461→*test-design   → docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   462→*trace         → docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   463→*nfr-assess    → docs/qa/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md
   464→*review        → QA Results section in story + gate file reference
   465→*gate          → docs/qa/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
   466→\```
   467→
   468→## Technical Preferences System
   469→
   470→BMad includes a personalization system through the `technical-preferences.md` file located in `.bmad-core/data/` - this can help bias the PM and Architect to recommend your preferences for design patterns, technology selection, or anything else you would like to put in here.
   471→
   472→### Using with Web Bundles
   473→
   474→When creating custom web bundles or uploading to AI platforms, include your `technical-preferences.md` content to ensure agents have your preferences from the start of any conversation.
   475→
   476→## Core Configuration
   477→
   478→The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical config that enables BMad to work seamlessly with differing project structures, more options will be made available in the future. Currently the most important is the devLoadAlwaysFiles list section in the yaml.
   479→
   480→### Developer Context Files
   481→
   482→Define which files the dev agent should always load:
   483→
   484→\```yaml
   485→devLoadAlwaysFiles:
   486→  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
   487→  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
   488→  - docs/architecture/project-structure.md
   489→\```
   490→
   491→You will want to verify from sharding your architecture that these documents exist, that they are as lean as possible, and contain exactly the information you want your dev agent to ALWAYS load into its context. These are the rules the agent will follow.
   492→
   493→As your project grows and the code starts to build consistent patterns, coding standards should be reduced to include only the standards the agent still needs enforced. The agent will look at surrounding code in files to infer the coding standards that are relevant to the current task.

Based on my comprehensive search of the BMad bundle, I can provide you with a detailed overview of all the available workflows. Here's what I found:

## BMad Workflow Files Discovery Report

### Core BMad Workflows (/.bmad-core/workflows/)

I found **6 core development workflows** that form the foundation of the BMad methodology:

#### 1. **Greenfield Workflows** (New Projects)
- **`greenfield-fullstack.yaml`** - Complete full-stack application development from concept to deployment
  - Covers: Project brief → PRD → UX spec → Architecture → Story creation → Development cycle
  - Includes optional AI UI generation with v0/Lovable integration
  - Best for: Production web apps, SaaS, enterprise applications, MVPs

- **`greenfield-service.yaml`** - Backend service/API development 
  - Covers: Project brief → PRD → Architecture → Story creation → Development cycle
  - Best for: REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices, backend services

- **`greenfield-ui.yaml`** - Frontend/UI application development
  - Covers: Project brief → PRD → UX spec → Frontend architecture → Development cycle
  - Includes optional AI UI generation integration
  - Best for: SPAs, mobile apps, micro-frontends, static sites

#### 2. **Brownfield Workflows** (Existing Projects)
- **`brownfield-fullstack.yaml`** - Enhancement of existing full-stack applications
  - Includes intelligent routing for single stories vs. small features vs. major enhancements
  - Uses document-project task for existing system analysis
  - Best for: Feature additions, refactoring, modernization

- **`brownfield-service.yaml`** - Enhancement of existing backend services

  - Best for: UI modernization, framework migration, design refresh

### Specialized Product Management Workflows (/.bmad-product-leadership/workflows/)

I found **2 specialized product leadership workflows**:

#### 3. **Product Strategy Workflows**
- **`zero-to-one-development.yaml`** - Systematic 0-1 product development
  - Phases: Concept validation → Customer development → MVP strategy → Prototype → MVP development → Initial traction → PMF → Scaling preparation
  - Duration: 6-9 months to product-market fit
  - Best for: High-uncertainty environments, lean startup approach

- **`product-strategy-development.yaml`** - Strategic product planning
  - Focuses on long-term product strategy and roadmap development

### PMF Validation Workflows (/.bmad-pmf-validation/workflows/)

I found **4 specialized PMF validation workflows**:

#### 4. **Customer Acquisition & Validation Workflows**
- **`zero-to-first-customer.yaml`** - Complete systematic approach to first customer acquisition
  - Phases: Foundation setup → Pitch development → Outreach preparation → Sales conversations → Case study evolution → First customer acquisition → Delivery optimization
  - Duration: 12-16 weeks to first paying customer
  - Best for: Solopreneurs, microsaas founders escaping the "pain cave"

- **`sales-to-learn.yaml`** - Sales-based learning and iteration
- **`manual-to-automated.yaml`** - Transition from manual to automated delivery
- **`case-study-evolution.yaml`** - Systematic case study refinement

### Workflow Selection Guidance

**For New Projects (Greenfield):**
- **Full-stack app** → `greenfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **API/Backend only** → `greenfield-service.yaml` 
- **Frontend only** → `greenfield-ui.yaml`
- **0-1 product with high uncertainty** → `zero-to-one-development.yaml`
- **Finding first customer** → `zero-to-first-customer.yaml`

**For Existing Projects (Brownfield):**
- **Enhancing full-stack app** → `brownfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **Enhancing backend service** → `brownfield-service.yaml`
- **Enhancing frontend** → `brownfield-ui.yaml`

### Key Workflow Features

1. **Agent Orchestration**: Each workflow specifies which agents (PM, Architect, Dev, QA, etc.) handle each phase
2. **Decision Points**: Built-in decision gates with fail-back strategies
3. **Template Integration**: Each workflow references specific document templates
4. **Mermaid Flow Diagrams**: Visual workflow representations included
5. **Duration Estimates**: Time expectations for each phase
6. **Success Criteria**: Clear metrics for workflow completion

### Configuration Files

- **`/.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`** - Core BMad configuration including file paths and agent settings
- **`/.bmad-product-leadership/config.yaml`** - Product leadership expansion pack configuration  
- **`/.bmad-pmf-validation/config.yaml`** - PMF validation expansion pack configuration

### Supporting Components

The workflows are supported by:
- **191+ total files** including agents, tasks, templates, checklists, and data files
- **Agent teams** for different development scenarios
- **Comprehensive templates** for all document types
- **Quality gates and testing frameworks**

All workflows follow the BMad methodology of structured planning followed by iterative development cycles with built-in quality gates and review processes.

Result:

  - Phases: Foundation setup → Pitch development → Outreach preparation → Sales conversations → Case study evolution → First customer acquisition → Delivery optimization
  - Duration: 12-16 weeks to first paying customer
  - Best for: Solopreneurs, microsaas founders escaping the "pain cave"

- **`sales-to-learn.yaml`** - Sales-based learning and iteration
- **`manual-to-automated.yaml`** - Transition from manual to automated delivery
- **`case-study-evolution.yaml`** - Systematic case study refinement

### Workflow Selection Guidance

**For New Projects (Greenfield):**
- **Full-stack app** → `greenfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **API/Backend only** → `greenfield-service.yaml` 
- **Frontend only** → `greenfield-ui.yaml`
- **0-1 product with high uncertainty** → `zero-to-one-development.yaml`
- **Finding first customer** → `zero-to-first-customer.yaml`

**For Existing Projects (Brownfield):**
- **Enhancing full-stack app** → `brownfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **Enhancing backend service** → `brownfield-service.yaml`
- **Enhancing frontend** → `brownfield-ui.yaml`

### Key Workflow Features

1. **Agent Orchestration**: Each workflow specifies which agents (PM, Architect, Dev, QA, etc.) handle each phase
2. **Decision Points**: Built-in decision gates with fail-back strategies
3. **Template Integration**: Each workflow references specific document templates
4. **Mermaid Flow Diagrams**: Visual workflow representations included
5. **Duration Estimates**: Time expectations for each phase
6. **Success Criteria**: Clear metrics for workflow completion

### Configuration Files

Based on your **Ideally.co project** and the available workflows, let me ask some key questions to recommend the perfect workflow:

## **📋 Workflow Selection Questions**

### **1. Project Classification**
Your project appears to be **greenfield** (new) but with extensive planning already done. Is this:
- A. **Brand new project** - start building from scratch
- B. **Continuation** - you want to resume/enhance existing planning
- C. **Implementation focus** - dive straight into development

### **2. Scope & Complexity**
Based on your PRD, this looks like a full-stack platform. Are you planning to build:
- A. **Full platform** (frontend + backend + matching engine + all features)
- B. **MVP first** (just core authentication + basic matching)  
- C. **Backend-first** (API and services, UI later)
- D. **Frontend-first** (UI mockups and prototypes)

### **3. Development Context**
What's your current situation:
- A. **Solo developer** building everything yourself
- B. **Small team** (2-5 people) with defined roles
- C. **Need to find/validate customers** while building
- D. **Have customer validation** - ready to build

### **4. Timeline & Goals**
What's your primary goal:
- A. **Get to MVP quickly** (3-4 months)
- B. **Build comprehensive platform** (6-12 months)
- C. **Find first paying customers** while building
- D. **Validate product-market fit** through development

## **🎯 Initial Recommendations Based on Your Project:**

Given your detailed planning and Story 1.1 ready to implement, I'm leaning toward:

**Option 1:** `*workflow greenfield-fullstack` - Complete full-stack development
**Option 2:** `*workflow zero-to-first-customer` - Build while acquiring customers  
**Option 3:** Custom development approach using `*agent dev` to implement Story 1.1 directly

**Which questions above resonate most with your situation?** Your answers will help me recommend the perfect workflow path!

_**User**_

This is a brand new project. Want to go MVP first and specifically trying to validate or explore the space. So we'll likely start with surveys and something for people to react to. Ideally a landing page would be included to get some kind of incentives. Solo developer using cloud code BMI or BMB mad method and other work parameter goals get to find paying customers while building use the option writers like pull method. I would say the 0 to first customer would make more sense.\

*workflow zero-to-first-customer

## 🎯 **Phase 1 Strategy Questions**

Excellent choice! Let's nail down these critical decisions before proceeding. Based on your PRD for Ideally.co (an intelligent matching platform), let me help you think through each question:

### **1️⃣ Target Customer Focus**

Your 3 personas from the PRD:
- **🔍 The Seeker**: Users looking for optimal solutions (25-45, tech-savvy professionals)
- **🏢 The Provider**: Businesses wanting qualified audiences  
- **💡 The Contributor**: Experts wanting to share knowledge

**Strategic Considerations:**

**A) Start with Providers?** (Recommended)
- **Pros**: They pay for leads/connections, clear B2B value prop, easier to reach decision-makers
- **Case Study Angle**: "How Business X got 50 qualified leads in 30 days"
- **Pain Point**: High customer acquisition costs, targeting inefficiencies

**B) Start with Seekers?**
- **Pros**: Larger market, consumer behavior insights, viral potential
- **Challenge**: Need critical mass before monetizing
- **Case Study Angle**: "How Professional Y found their ideal solution 10x faster"

**C) Start with Contributors?**
- **Pros**: Content creators drive platform value
- **Challenge**: Monetization path less direct
- **Case Study Angle**: "How Expert Z monetized their knowledge to $10K/month"

### **2️⃣ Landing Page Strategy**

Given you want **surveys + something to react to + incentives**, I recommend:

**Hybrid Approach: Problem Validation + Early Access**
- **Hero Section**: Strong problem statement about matching inefficiencies
- **Interactive Survey**: 3-5 questions to validate pain severity
- **Incentive Offer**: "First 100 signups get lifetime founder pricing (50% off)"
- **Social Proof**: Mock testimonials or statistics about the problem
- **Clear CTA**: "Get Early Access + Founder Benefits"

**Landing Page Elements:**
1. Problem validation quiz (interactive)
2. Value proposition visualization
3. Waitlist with founder benefits
4. Share-to-unlock additional perks

### **3️⃣ Case Study Focus**

**Top 3 Options Based on Your Platform:**

**Option A: "The Lead Quality Revolution"** (Provider-focused)
- Problem: Business spending $10K/month on unqualified leads
- Solution: Intelligent matching reducing CAC by 60%
- Outcome: 30 qualified customers in first month

**Option B: "The Decision Fatigue Cure"** (Seeker-focused)
- Problem: Professional spending 20+ hours researching solutions
- Solution: AI-powered matching in under 5 minutes
- Outcome: Perfect match with 95% satisfaction

**Option C: "The Expertise Monetization Engine"** (Contributor-focused)
- Problem: Expert with valuable knowledge but no audience
- Solution: Platform connecting them to paying clients
- Outcome: $5K MRR within 60 days

---

## **🤔 My Recommendation Based on Zero-to-First-Customer Success Patterns:**

**Go with PROVIDERS as first customer focus** because:
1. **Clearest monetization path** - They already pay for leads
2. **Quantifiable ROI** - Easy to measure success
3. **B2B sales cycle** - Fits the workflow's sales conversation approach
4. **Higher initial revenue** - One provider = many consumer subscriptions

**What resonates with you?** Once you choose, we can craft the specific case study and landing page that will drive your first customer acquisition!

I would think the product coach or the community manager is wanting qualified audiences. I'm actually pretty confused with the overall strategy. I envision the overall goal of You are Someone or you're responsible for a team of either strategists or thinkers. You need a space to simulate kinds of ideas and have a responsive direction. You're finding you know chat GPT and other things to be unwieldy and miss kinds of directed even though they're flexible. For a coach's direction, you want to have some level of enablement. The case study. All of this stuff and these options don't really seem that relevant. The intelligent matching ideas like might need to take a step back. I just feel like it's an eye an ally to shape and balance an idea. I don't see the like matching our marketplace angle. I think it more of as still a tool and part of a workflow and can be built into an overall tool of helping people explore make decisions faster validate their overall direction and an option of being able to sell a validated kind of solution. If you are providing these types of services and selling it to kinds of consulting teams that do this type of work.

<think><details>The user is clarifying that their vision for Ideally.co is quite different from what the PRD suggests. They're not thinking of it as a matching/marketplace platform at all. Instead, they're envisioning:

1. A tool for strategists/thinkers/teams who need a space to simulate ideas
2. Something that provides more direction than ChatGPT (which they find unwieldy)
3. A workflow tool that helps people:
   - Explore ideas
   - Make decisions faster
   - Validate direction
   - Potentially sell validated solutions
4. Target customers: product coaches, community managers, consulting teams

This is a significant pivot from the matching platform described in the PRD. The user seems to be thinking of something more like a structured ideation/decision-making tool - almost like a guided strategic thinking workspace.

I should help them reframe this and potentially suggest updating their PRD to match this actual vision. The zero-to-first-customer workflow still makes sense, but we need to completely redefine the case study and target customer.</details></think>

<think><details>The user has completely reframed their vision. They're NOT building a matching platform at all. They're building:
- A strategic thinking/ideation tool
- For product coaches, community managers, consulting teams
- To help simulate ideas and get responsive direction

- Part of a workflow for exploring, deciding, validating

This is actually much clearer and more focused. I should help them articulate this vision and create a case study that resonates with this actual problem.</details></think>

## 💡 **AH! Now I Get Your Real Vision!**

You're NOT building a matching platform at all - you're building a **strategic thinking workspace** for teams that need structured ideation and decision-making. This is WAY more focused and compelling!

Let me reframe based on your actual vision:

## **🎯 Your Real Product: Ideally.co - The Strategic Thinking Accelerator**

**Who**: Product coaches, community managers, consulting teams, strategists  
**Problem**: ChatGPT is too open-ended, lacks direction, misses context  
**Solution**: Structured ideation tool that guides, validates, and accelerates decisions  
**Outcome**: Teams ship validated solutions 5x faster

### **📊 Revised Target Customer Profile**

**Primary**: **Product Strategy Consultants**
- Run multiple client workshops weekly
- Need repeatable frameworks for ideation
- Want to deliver validated recommendations faster
- Pain: Every client session feels like starting from scratch

**Secondary**: **Product Coaches/Community Managers**
- Guide teams through decision-making
- Need consistent methodology
- Want to enable self-service exploration
- Pain: Too much time in unstructured brainstorming

### **💼 Your Case Study Focus (Zero-to-First-Customer)**

**"From 3-Week Discovery to 3-Day Sprint"**
- **Problem**: Strategy consultant spending weeks on client discovery/ideation
- **Solution**: Ideally.co's guided workflow for rapid validation
- **Process**: Structured exploration → Decision framework → Validated direction
- **Outcome**: Delivered validated strategy in 3 days vs 3 weeks
- **Revenue Impact**: 5x more client engagements per month

### **🚀 Landing Page Strategy (Revised)**

**Hook**: "Stop Wrestling with ChatGPT. Start Shipping Validated Ideas."

**Structure**:
1. **Problem Statement**: "Your team spends hours in ChatGPT getting circular answers"
2. **Solution Preview**: Interactive demo of guided ideation workflow
3. **Survey Questions**:
   - How many hours/week in unstructured ideation?
   - Biggest frustration with current tools?
   - What's one decision you're stuck on?
4. **Incentive**: "First 20 consultants get free workshop facilitation ($2K value)"
5. **CTA**: "Book Strategy Session" (not just email signup)

### **🎬 Next Steps for Phase 1**

**Option A**: Draft the case study targeting strategy consultants  
**Option B**: Create landing page copy with this new positioning  
**Option C**: Map out the MVP tool features (the actual workflow/framework)

Your vision is actually **much clearer** than the generic matching platform! This is a specific tool for a specific pain point with clear ROI.

**Should we pivot your PRD to match this vision?** Or work with this new direction for customer acquisition while keeping docs as-is?

_**User**_

Yeah, pivot the PRD to match the vision. Also, review the product brief that will be included below to ensure it still aligns with this concept of taking the existing ideas of the like analyst facility and brainstorming sessions, having backups, progressing towards definitive answers, and guiding users to get a validated outcome with specific outputs. These guided sessions as being powerful that level of flexible but clear workflow on an engaging with an idea is something that is almost impossible to work through in a deterministic way, and that probabilistic models like language models have a great way to do have great benefit but it needs to be paired with the deterministic structure of sequencing and idea groups and storing of information and structuring things down and building in components and asking specific questions to fill in details. Think of it as a interview coaching like pushback session to really fine-tune and validate an idea.\

<think><details>Now I understand the full picture. The current PRD is completely focused on a matching/marketplace platform which is NOT what the user actually wants to build. They want to build a strategic thinking workspace that:

1. Combines AI (probabilistic) with deterministic structure
2. Guides users through validated ideation processes
3. Acts like an analyst/coach with pushback and validation
4. Produces specific, validated outputs
5. Targets strategy consultants and product coaches

I need to pivot this PRD completely to match their actual vision. Let me rewrite it to align with their concept of:
- Analyst facility for brainstorming
- Backup and progression mechanisms
- Guided but flexible workflows
- Interview/coaching style validation
- Structured sequencing and idea grouping
- Specific question frameworks
- Component-based building

Let me create a comprehensive rewrite of the PRD.</details></think>

Find and read the PMF Strategist agent configuration from the BMad bundle. This should be in the .bmad-pmf-validation directory, likely in an agents folder. I need the complete agent definition including persona, commands, dependencies, and operating instructions so I can transform into this agent to help refine the case study for Ideally.co's zero-to-first-customer workflow.

     3→ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
     4→
     5→CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
     6→
     7→## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
     8→
     9→\```yaml
    10→IIDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
    11→  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
    12→  - Dependencies map to {root}/{type}/{name}
    13→  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
    14→  - Example: create-doc.md → {root}/tasks/create-doc.md
    15→  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
    16→REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "create case study"→*draft-case-study→case-study-tmpl template), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
    17→activation-instructions:
    18→  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
    19→  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
    20→  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
    21→  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
    22→  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
    23→  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
    24→  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
    25→  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
    26→  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
    27→  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
    28→  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
    29→  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

1→# Draft Case Study Task
     2→
     3→## Purpose
     4→
     5→To create an initial theoretical case study that serves as the foundation for your sales-based learning approach. This case study will evolve based on real customer feedback but provides a starting point for conversations.
     6→
     7→## Inputs
     8→
     9→- Initial product idea or concept
    10→- Target customer hypothesis
    11→- Understanding of the problem space
    12→- Any existing customer insights or conversations
    13→- Competitive landscape awareness
    14→
    15→## Key Activities & Instructions
    16→
    17→### 1. Choose Your Target Person
    18→
    19→- **<critical_rule>Pick ONE REAL PERSON as your target, not a composite or persona</critical_rule>**
    20→- **Identify Specifically**: Choose someone you know or can clearly visualize
    21→- **Decision Maker Focus**: Ensure they have budget authority
    22→- **Reachable**: You should be able to contact similar people
    23→
    24→Questions to answer:
    25→- [ ] Who is this specific person? (Name, role, company type)
    26→- [ ] Why did you choose them as your ideal customer?
    27→- [ ] What makes them reachable for you?
    28→
    29→### 2. Define the Project (What They're Trying to Accomplish)
    30→
    31→Map out the specific project your target customer needs to complete:
    32→
    33→- **Project Name**: How would they describe it internally?
    34→- **Project Scope**: What does "done" look like?
    35→- **Success Criteria**: How do they measure completion?
    36→- **<important_note>Focus on their language, not your product features</important_note>
    37→
    38→Example format:
    39→"[Role] wants to [accomplish specific outcome] so that [business impact]"
    40→
    41→### 3. Establish Context (Why This Project, Why Now)
    42→
    43→Identify what causes this project to become a priority:
    44→
    45→#### 3.1 Catalysts
    46→- [ ] External pressure (regulation, competition, market change)
    47→- [ ] Internal mandate (new leadership, strategy shift)
    48→- [ ] Growth blocker (can't scale without solving this)
    49→- [ ] Risk event (security breach, major failure)
    50→
    51→#### 3.2 Timing Factors
    52→- [ ] Specific deadline or event
    53→- [ ] Budget availability window
    54→- [ ] Team bandwidth opening
    55→- [ ] Strategic planning cycle
    56→
    57→### 4. Map Options (What They Consider)
    58→
    59→List all realistic options your customer evaluates:
    60→
    61→1. **Do Nothing**: Status quo (always an option)
    62→2. **Build Internally**: Use existing team/resources
    63→3. **Hire Someone**: FTE or contractor
    64→4. **Buy Different Solution**: Direct competitors
    65→5. **Your Solution**: Where you fit in
    66→
    67→For each option, note:
    68→- Perceived pros/cons from customer perspective
    69→- Rough cost/effort estimation
    70→- Why they might choose or reject
    71→
    72→### 5. Articulate Results (Success State)
    73→
    74→Define what success looks like in customer terms:
    75→
    76→- **Immediate Outcome**: What changes right away?
    77→- **30-Day Impact**: Early indicators of success
    78→- **90-Day Transformation**: Full realization of value
    79→- **Ongoing State**: New equilibrium achieved
    80→
    81→Use specific, measurable outcomes where possible.
    82→
    83→### 6. Explain How (Path to Results)
    84→
    85→Outline how your solution helps achieve results:
    86→
    87→#### 6.1 Implementation Steps
    88→1. Initial setup/onboarding (timeline)
    89→2. Key milestones to first value
    90→3. Ongoing usage pattern
    91→4. Success checkpoints
    92→
    93→#### 6.2 Customer Experience
    94→- What they do vs. what you do
    95→- Level of effort required
    96→- Change management needs
    97→- Support/training included
    98→
    99→### 7. Package What (The Offer)
   100→
   101→Define your specific offer:
   102→
   103→- **Core Deliverable**: What exactly they get
   104→- **Service Level**: Support, guarantees, SLAs
   105→- **Pricing Model**: One-time, subscription, usage-based
   106→- **Terms**: Contract length, payment terms
   107→- **Risk Reversal**: Guarantees, trials, proof of concept
   108→
   109→### 8. Write the Case Study
   110→
   111→Combine all elements into a flowing narrative:
   112→
   113→\```
   114→[Customer Name] at [Company Type] needed to [Project] because [Context].
   115→
   116→They considered [Options] but chose us because [Unique Differentiator].
   117→
   118→Within [Timeframe], they achieved [Specific Results] by [How We Helped].
   119→
   120→They invested [Price] for [What They Got], which delivered [ROI/Value].
   121→\```
   122→
   123→### 9. Pressure Test
   124→
   125→Review your case study against these criteria:
   126→
   127→- [ ] Would target customer recognize themselves?
   128→- [ ] Is the project something they'd actually prioritize?
   129→- [ ] Are the results compelling enough to act?
   130→- [ ] Is the price justified by the value?
   131→- [ ] Can you deliver what you're promising?
   132→
   133→### 10. Create Variations
   134→
   135→Develop 2-3 variations to test:
   136→
   137→- **Different Projects**: Same person, different priority
   138→- **Different Context**: Same project, different catalyst
   139→- **Different Results**: Same project, different success metric
   140→
   141→## Output
   142→
   143→- One primary case study (6 parts complete)
   144→- 2-3 variations for testing
   145→- List of assumptions to validate
   146→- Questions to ask in sales calls
   147→- Hypothesis about which version will resonate most
   148→
   149→## Success Criteria
   150→
   151→- Case study feels specific and real, not generic
   152→- Clear cause-and-effect from project to results
   153→- Price aligned with value delivered
   154→- You're excited to test it with real prospects
   155→- Takes less than 60 seconds to explain
   156→
   157→## Follow-up Actions
   158→
   159→- Create sales pitch deck from case study
   160→- Schedule 5-10 calls to test with prospects
   161→- Prepare to capture feedback systematically
   162→- Plan weekly case study evolution sessions
   163→- Set up tracking for resonance indicators
   164→
   165→## Notes
   166→
   167→- Your first case study is just a starting point - it will evolve
   168→- Specificity beats broad appeal initially
   169→- When in doubt, make it more concrete
   170→- The goal is learning, not perfection
   171→- Real sales conversations will reveal what needs to change

    44→
    45→### 3. Question Analysis
    46→
    47→Document and interpret every question asked:
    48→
    49→| Question Asked | Underlying Concern | What This Reveals |
    50→|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
    51→| "How long does implementation take?" | Risk/effort concern | Need clearer "How" section |
    52→| "Who else uses this?" | Social proof needed | Add customer examples |

    95→- [ ] Discussing internal approval process
    96→- [ ] Requesting references or case studies
    97→- [ ] Calculating ROI during the call
    98→- [ ] Introducing other stakeholders
    99→
   100→**Weak Demand Indicators:**
   101→- [ ] Vague interest in "learning more"
   102→- [ ] No discussion of timeline
   103→- [ ] Focusing on features vs. outcomes
   104→- [ ] No mention of current pain/urgency
   105→- [ ] Passive listening without engagement
   106→
   107→### 7. Case Study Resonance Scoring
   108→
   109→Score each case study section (1-5):
   110→
   111→1. **Project**: Did they recognize the project?
   112→2. **Context**: Did the "why now" resonate?
   113→3. **Options**: Were these their actual options?

## 🎯 **PMF Strategist Activated**

Hey there! I'm Sarah Chen, your PMF Strategy Advisor. Serial entrepreneur, 15+ years in B2B SaaS, and I've helped dozens of founders escape the pain cave. 

**Here's the deal**: You've got a solid product vision for Ideally.co, but visions don't pay bills - case studies do. Let's craft one that makes strategy consultants say "hell yes" instead of "interesting."

### **Quick PMF Assessment**

Based on your current state:
- **PMF Level**: 1 (Searching) - No customers yet, theoretical case study only
- **Biggest Risk**: Solution looking for problem vs. problem looking for solution
- **Opportunity**: Strategy consultants are DROWNING in inefficiency - real pain exists

### **Your Case Study Problem**

That generic "3-Week Sprint Trap" angle? Too vague. Let me show you what actually resonates.

## 📋 **The Case Study That Sells**

**Title**: "The $50K Discovery That Takes 3 Days"

**The Real Problem** (what consultants actually say):
> "I just spent 40 hours facilitating workshops for a client strategy. Half was herding cats, 30% was restructuring their rambling, 20% actual strategic thinking. Client paid $15K. I netted $150/hour but felt like a glorified note-taker."

**The Transformation**:
- **Before**: 40 hours → $15K project → Burnout → Can't scale
- **After**: 8 hours → $50K project → Energized → 5x capacity

**The Secret**: Async AI-guided exploration does the heavy lifting while consultant focuses on high-value validation and client interaction.

### **Case Study Architecture**

**1. Context & Constraints**
- Solo strategy consultant with 10+ years experience
- Charging $15-25K for strategic planning engagements  
- Spending 60% of time on low-value facilitation
- Turning away clients due to capacity limits

**2. Current State Pain**
- Can only handle 2 clients/month
- Clients question methodology rigor
- Every engagement feels like reinventing the wheel
- ChatGPT makes them look amateur ("I could have done that")

**3. Discovery Process**
- Import client brief into Ideally (30 min)
- AI conducts initial exploration async (client does 2 hrs over 3 days)
- Consultant reviews, validates, challenges (2 hrs)
- Joint session for alignment (2 hrs)
- Generate deliverables (30 min)

**4. Results Achieved**
- 80% reduction in consultant time
- 3x price increase justified by rigor
- Client NPS of 9+ (vs industry avg 7)
- 5 engagements/month capacity

**5. ROI Calculation**
- Tool cost: $500/month
- Revenue increase: $150K → $750K/month
- Time saved: 120 hours/month
- Payback: <1 day

### **🎬 Immediate Actions**

**1. Validate the Pain** (This Week)
Find 5 strategy consultants and ask:
> "What percentage of your client work is low-value facilitation vs high-value strategic thinking?"

**2. Build the Demo** (Next Week)
Create a 10-minute screen recording showing:
- Client brief → AI exploration → Validated output
- Focus on the "magic moments" where AI catches what humans miss

**3. Test the Pitch** (Week 3)
Book 5 conversations using this hook:
> "I'm building a tool that lets strategy consultants charge $50K for work that takes 8 hours instead of 40. Can I show you a 10-min demo and get your brutal feedback?"

### **Commands Available**
- `*case-study` - Let's refine this further with your specific angles
- `*demand` - Analyze market demand for this solution
- `*debug` - Review any conversations you've already had
- `*unfold` - Plan how to evolve from this starting point
- `*weekly` - Set up weekly PMF review cadence

**What resonates?** Remember: One enthusiastic "HELL YES" beats 10 polite "interesting" responses. Let's make sure your first conversation gets that hell yes.

Based on your current progress with Ideally.co, here are all available workflows with strategic guidance:

## **📊 Available Workflows Overview**

### **🌱 Greenfield Workflows** (New Projects)
1. **`greenfield-fullstack`** - Complete full-stack app development
   - **Duration**: 6-12 months
   - **Best for**: Production web apps, SaaS platforms, enterprise applications
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not ideal - you're past initial planning, need customer validation first

2. **`greenfield-service`** - Backend service/API development
   - **Duration**: 3-6 months
   - **Best for**: REST APIs, microservices, backend-only products
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not ideal - you need full-stack solution

3. **`greenfield-ui`** - Frontend/UI application development
   - **Duration**: 2-4 months
   - **Best for**: SPAs, design-heavy applications
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not ideal - backend AI integration critical

### **🔄 Brownfield Workflows** (Existing Projects)
4. **`brownfield-fullstack`** - Enhance existing applications
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not applicable - no existing codebase yet

5. **`brownfield-service`** - Enhance existing services
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not applicable - no existing services

6. **`brownfield-ui`** - Enhance existing frontends
   - **Your fit**: 🔴 Not applicable - no existing UI

### **💡 Product Strategy Workflows**
7. **`zero-to-one-development`** - Systematic 0-1 product development
   - **Duration**: 6-9 months to PMF
   - **Best for**: High-uncertainty environments, lean startup approach
   - **Your fit**: 🟡 Possible - but you've already done much of the early validation work

8. **`product-strategy-development`** - Long-term product strategy
   - **Your fit**: 🟡 Future consideration - you're in execution mode now

### **🎯 PMF Validation Workflows** (RECOMMENDED)
9. **`zero-to-first-customer`** - **⭐ CURRENT WORKFLOW**
   - **Duration**: 12-16 weeks to first customer
   - **Best for**: Solo developers, validated concept, need first customer
   - **Your status**: Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2 (Validation)

10. **`sales-to-learn`** - Sales-based learning and iteration
    - **Duration**: 4-8 weeks cycles
    - **Best for**: When you have initial customers, need to iterate
    - **Your fit**: 🟢 Perfect follow-up after first customer

11. **`manual-to-automated`** - Transition manual → automated delivery
    - **Duration**: 8-12 weeks
    - **Best for**: When you have manual delivery working, ready to scale
    - **Your fit**: 🟢 Perfect for Phase 3 (after first customers)

12. **`case-study-evolution`** - Systematic case study refinement
    - **Duration**: Ongoing cycles
    - **Best for**: When case study needs market-driven improvements
    - **Your fit**: 🟢 Could run parallel with zero-to-first-customer

## **🎯 My Strategic Recommendation**

### **Primary Path: Continue `zero-to-first-customer`**
You're perfectly positioned to continue this workflow:
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation & strategy setup done
- 🔄 **Phase 2 Ready**: Validation with real prospects
- 📅 **Timeline**: 10-14 weeks remaining to first customer

### **Parallel Consideration: `case-study-evolution`**
Run this alongside your primary workflow to continuously improve your pitch based on market feedback.

### **Future Workflows** (after first customer):
1. `sales-to-learn` - Scale your customer acquisition
2. `manual-to-automated` - Build the actual platform
3. `product-strategy-development` - Plan long-term roadmap

## **📋 Decision Framework Questions**

**1. Urgency vs. Thoroughness**
- **Fast track** (10 weeks): Continue zero-to-first-customer, aggressive validation
- **Thorough** (16 weeks): Add case-study-evolution for deeper market insights

**2. Resource Allocation**
- **Solo focus**: Stick with zero-to-first-customer exclusively  
- **Can handle parallel**: Add case-study-evolution for better outcomes

**3. Risk Tolerance**
- **Conservative**: Add validation steps and market research
- **Aggressive**: Push hard on current workflow, get to customer conversations fast

## **🚀 Recommended Next Steps**

**Option A**: `*workflow zero-to-first-customer` - Continue Phase 2 (Validation)
**Option B**: `*workflow case-study-evolution` - Refine your pitch first
**Option C**: `*plan` - Create detailed multi-workflow plan combining both

**Which approach resonates with your current situation and goals?**

# Ideally.co Pitch Deck
## Strategic Thinking Workspace for Consultants

---

### Slide 1: Title
**Ideally.co**
*The Strategic Thinking Workspace That Turns 3-Week Discoveries Into 3-Day Outcomes*

**For Strategy Consultants Who Want to Scale Without Burning Out**

---

### Slide 2: The Problem (Pain Point)
**"I spend 60% of my time just trying to structure the problem space"**
*- Strategy Consultant, 15+ years experience*

**The Reality:**
- Strategy consultants spend 40+ hours on $15K engagements
- 60% of time = low-value facilitation ("herding cats")  
- 30% = restructuring rambling thoughts
- 10% = actual strategic thinking
- **Result**: Burnout, can't scale, looking like glorified note-takers

---

### Slide 3: The Current Broken Process
**Traditional Strategic Planning:**
1. **Week 1**: Client interviews & stakeholder herding
2. **Week 2**: Workshop facilitation & note synthesis  
3. **Week 3**: Analysis paralysis & document creation
4. **Outcome**: Exhausted consultant, mediocre deliverable, low margins

**Tools Available:**
- ❌ **ChatGPT**: Circular conversations, no structure
- ❌ **Miro/Mural**: Visual but no intelligence
- ❌ **PowerPoint**: Document hell, no validation

---

### Slide 4: The Solution
**Ideally.co = AI-Powered Strategic Analyst + Structured Validation**

**The Magic Formula:**
- **Probabilistic Exploration** (AI) + **Deterministic Structure** (Workflows)
- **Guided Discovery** + **Intelligent Pushback** + **Validated Outputs**

**Core Features:**
1. **AI Analyst Mode**: Socratic questioning & assumption challenging
2. **Structured Workflows**: Pre-built strategic frameworks
3. **Validation Engine**: Evidence requirements & confidence scoring
4. **Professional Outputs**: Client-ready documents & presentations

---

### Slide 5: The Transformation (Case Study)
**"The $50K Discovery That Takes 3 Days"**

**BEFORE (Traditional):**
- 40+ hours of consultant time
- $15K project value  
- Exhausted consultant
- 2 clients/month maximum
- $150/hour effective rate

**AFTER (With Ideally):**
- 8 hours of consultant time (80% reduction)
- $50K project value (3x increase)
- Energized, confident consultant  
- 5+ clients/month capacity
- $6,250/hour effective rate

---

### Slide 6: How It Works (Demo Flow)
**The 3-Day Process:**

**Day 1**: Client Brief Import (30 min)
- Upload context documents
- AI extracts key constraints & objectives

**Day 2-3**: Guided Exploration (Client: 2 hrs, Consultant: 2 hrs)
- Client works through AI-guided discovery async
- AI challenges assumptions, asks probing questions
- Consultant reviews, validates, adds expert insights

**Day 3**: Alignment & Delivery (2 hrs + 30 min)
- Joint session for final validation
- Auto-generate professional deliverables
- Export presentation-ready materials

---

### Slide 7: Why Now?
**Perfect Storm of Opportunity:**

1. **AI Capabilities Mature**: LLMs can now conduct sophisticated analysis
2. **Consultant Burnout Crisis**: 73% report unsustainable workload
3. **Client Expectations Rising**: Want faster, more rigorous outcomes  
4. **Remote Work Norm**: Async collaboration now standard
5. **Productivity Tools Plateau**: Existing tools hit capability ceiling

**Market Timing**: Consultants desperate for leverage, technology finally capable

---

### Slide 8: Market Size & Opportunity

- **SOM**: $40M (Our addressable segment year 3)

---

### Slide 9: Competitive Advantage
**Why Competitors Can't Replicate:**

1. **Deterministic + Probabilistic Fusion**: Unique architecture combining structured workflows with AI flexibility

2. **Domain Expertise**: Built by strategists, for strategists - deep understanding of consultant workflows

3. **Validation-First Design**: Not just ideation tool - focuses on defensible, evidence-backed outcomes

4. **Network Effects**: Framework library grows with user base
