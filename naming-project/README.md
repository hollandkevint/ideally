# Strategic Naming Project

## Project Overview
**Objective:** ✅ COMPLETED - Successfully rebranded BMad Method platform from "ideally.co" to "ThinkHaven" (domain conflict with existing marketing agency resolved)

**Approach:** PMF-driven naming using Lexicon Branding methodology combined with systematic validation

## Current Status
- ✅ Diamond Framework analysis complete
- ✅ Initial name generation (50+ candidates across 5 categories)  
- ✅ Top candidates identified based on user feedback
- ⏳ **Next Phase:** Validation testing with target users

## Files in This Project
- `naming-exercise-progress.md` - Complete session notes and candidate analysis
- `validation-checklist.md` - Step-by-step validation framework  
- `README.md` - This overview file

## Top 3 Current Candidates
1. **IDEAFLOW** - Brainstorm companion that helps ideas flow systematically
2. **RIGORA** - Rigorous strategic analysis methodology  
3. **THINKWELL** - Strategic thinking wellness/safe space approach

## Next Actions
1. Run customer validation tests (see checklist)
2. Check domain/trademark availability for top candidates
3. A/B test positioning on landing page
4. Make final decision based on PMF criteria + legal availability

## Key Insights
- Strong user resonance with "safe space to explore ideas" positioning
- "Brainstorm companion" angle more appealing than pure "rigorous analysis"
- Need balance between systematic methodology and approachable experience
